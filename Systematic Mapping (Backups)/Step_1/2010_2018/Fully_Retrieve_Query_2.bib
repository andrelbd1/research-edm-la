	abstract = {Abstract Fast advancement of technology has led to an increased interest for using information technology to provide feedback based on learning behavior observations. This work outlines a novel approach for analyzing behavioral learner data through the application of process mining techniques specifically targeting a complex problem solving process. We realize this in the context of one particular learning case, namely, domain modeling. This work extends our previous research on process-mining analysis of domain modeling behavior of novices by elaborating with new insights from a replication study enhanced with an extra observation on how novices verify/validate models. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the results contribute to improving our knowledge on the cognitive aspects of problem-solving behavior of novices in the area of domain modeling, specifically regarding process-oriented feedback as opposed to traditional outcome feedback (is a solution correct? Why (not)?) usually applied in this type of courses. Ultimately, the outcomes of the work can be inspirational outside of the area of domain modeling as learning event data is becoming readily available through virtual learning environments and other information systems.},

Prior research has investigated the impact of forum reading and posting, as well as access to reading resources, on academic performance. However, little is known about the relationship between the temporal frequency of these activities and individual student’s performance. In addition, some studies have proposed different categorizations of student activities, and proved the usefulness of these characterizations for predictive purposes and better understanding of the learning process. One of the biggest concerns when teaching courses in a virtual learning environment is to create and develop instruction in a way that it improves the overall learning experience and results. The present study addresses this concern by drawing upon factors influencing academic performance; more specifically, the study focuses on objective factors related to the interaction between the student and the system (number of resources visited in the learning platform, and number of forum posts and views). On top of that, a visualization tool was designed and implemented to allow for further investigation of the relevance of the study variables. The results from the study show that there is a recurrent pattern in the frequency of behaviors and performance across different courses.},

This paper presents our approach on how the usage of \{VLEs\} (Virtual Learning Environments) can be traced and used to enhance the teaching quality so as to improve engagement. We focus our work on secondary education. The question is not to predict the performance of students, from the collected data, which is always controversial; or just define a set of pre-established metrics, obtained from the digital data contained into the VLE, and monitor them, indirectly inducing an assessment regime. The aim is to look beyond the traces left by students and to measure the motivation of a student in a particular task, of a given subject, and in a specific day. For this purpose, we rely on the psychometric theory of measurement to build a composite index of motivation and we embed it into a Learning Analytics system. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide teachers and stakeholders with objective and accurate (quasi) real time information about students’ motivation for learning, and hence adequately adapt and personalize the teaching methodologies and strategies in classrooms. The approach is general and can also be used in tertiary education for training students and researchers in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many researchers who study the impact of computer-based assessment (CBA) focus on the affordances or complexities of \{CBA\} approaches in comparison to traditional assessment methods. This study examines how \{CBA\} approaches were configured within and between modules, and the impact of assessment design on students' engagement, satisfaction, and pass rates. The analysis was conducted using a combination of longitudinal visualisations, correlational analysis, and fixed-effect models on 74 undergraduate modules and their 72,377 students. Our findings indicate that educators designed very different assessment strategies, which significantly influenced student engagement as measured by time spent in the virtual learning environment (VLE). Weekly analyses indicated that assessment activities were balanced with other learning activities, which suggests that educators tended to aim for a consistent workload when designing assessment strategies. Since most of the assessments were computer-based, students spent more time on the \{VLE\} during assessment weeks. By controlling for heterogeneity within and between modules, learning design could explain up to 69\% of the variability in students' time spent on the VLE. Furthermore, assessment activities were significantly related to pass rates, but no clear relation with satisfaction was found. Our findings highlight the importance of \{CBA\} and learning design to how students learn online.},

Although learning design is widely studied, often these studies are individual courses or programmes and few empirical studies have connected learning designs of a substantial number of courses with learning behaviour. In this study we linked 151 modules and 111.256 students with students' behaviour (\&lt;400 million minutes of online behaviour), satisfaction and performance at the Open University \{UK\} using multiple regression models. Our findings strongly indicate the importance of learning design in predicting and understanding Virtual Learning Environment behaviour and performance of students in blended and online environments. In line with proponents of social learning theories, our primary predictor for academic retention was the time learners spent on communication activities, controlling for various institutional and disciplinary factors.

The well-known standardised vocabularies of teaching/learning methods and \{LOs\} types were used to establish these interconnections. The sets portrait of these interconnections is followed by the appropriate ontology. The ontology is considered as an appropriate tool to create learners’ personalised learning environments consisting of LOs, suitable teaching/learning methods and activities according to their preferred learning styles. The ontology should help the learner to find suitable \{LOs\} according to preferred learning methods/activities, and vice versa, and thus to personalise learning.

	abstract = {Most investors lack financial knowledge and information for trading in the stock market. The objective of this study was to enhance the motivation and learning efficiency for students attending a course in financial management. A web-based virtual stock trading (VST) system, embedded with provided functions for financial ratio analysis, was designed to simulate a stock trading environment. Through learning with objective financial analyses, the state of learners’ minds is expected not to be affected by news or market fluctuations, which in turn nurtures the students as rational investors. Students were recruited from two universities located in central Taiwan for this study. They were given a virtual budget at the beginning of the semester for online virtual trading. The stock trading behavior, such as risk aversion and disposition effect, was explored through students’ trading histories. Furthermore, the learning outcome was evaluated with analysis of trading performance based on five indicators, including returns on budget, stock’s trading amount turnover, profit margin of stock trading amount, average budget utilization rate, and returns on average investment amount. Finally, perceived usefulness and behavior intention of the \{VST\} system were surveyed using a questionnaire instrument based on the extended technical acceptance model (TAM). The analytic results support risk aversion theory in that students tended to sell high-priced stocks in short periods with a holding day of 4.03±4.93(N=32) because of its great price fluctuation even if its price was rising during the study period. In contrast, the holding days of high-priced stocks were significantly shorter than the stocks ( t -test, p \&lt; 0.01 ) with lower prices (10.70±11.92,N=1136). At the end of the semester, questionnaires were disseminated to the 136 participating students, a total of 103 questionnaires were received with a response rate of 75.74\%. The Cronbach’s Alpha value was as high as 0.88, indicating that the questionnaire achieved high reliability. It shows that perceived usefulness (4.39±0.53) and behavior intention (4.31±0.50) are significantly higher than the neutral value (3) at a level of 0.001 using one-sample t -test, showing that the \{VST\} system is useful and the students are willing to further adopt the system and recommend it to other users. After analyses of the received questionnaires with structural equation model (SEM), \{TAM\} was verified regarding the adoption of \{VST\} as a tool for financial management education. In conclusion, the proposed \{VST\} system is useful in financial management education, specific in stock trading, to provide students with knowledge and experience to profit from the stock market through active learning in a virtual trading environment.},

This study proposes a TAM3-based model – with the inclusion of two additional variables: personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology and perceived interaction – to study the factors influencing the acceptance of e-learning systems. Attention is also brought towards the role of behavioral intention, especially in its relation with use behavior. In order to do so, two different settings were considered: higher education and lifelong learning; data was gathered from a survey administrated to Spanish graduate and lifelong learning students, and partial least squares analysis was used to test the research model. Results supported \{TAM\} relations, except for the intention-behavior linkage, and unveiled a dual nature of perceived usefulness – with one component related to efficiency and performance, and another component related to flexibility. The adequacy of applying TAM3-based models in educational contexts and suitability of actual system usage measures are also discussed.},

Critical thinking (CT) skills entails the ability(ies) of mental processes of discernment, analysis and evaluation to achieve a logical understanding. Critical thinking in the classroom as well as in the workplace is a central theme; however, with the dramatic increase of \{IT\} usage the mechanisms by which critical thinking is fostered and used has changed. This article presents the work and results of critical thinking in a virtual learning environment. We therefore present a web-based course and we assess in which parts of the course, and to what extent, critical thinking was perceived to occur. The course contained two categories of learning modules namely resources and interactive components. Critical thinking was measured subjectively using the \{ART\} scale. Results indicate the significance of “interactivity” in what students perceived to be critical-thinking-oriented versus online material as a resource.

Yet, current taxonomies of human actions were developed based on need in specific research, still lacking a general taxonomy. The taxonomy of goal-oriented actions in virtual training environments was developed to overcome this problem and will be discussed in this paper.},

The aim of the chapter is to provide a methodology description that can be used in the modeling of a virtual learning environment (VLE) for stakeholders’ behavior with reference to time. The presented methodology allows the probability modeling of stakeholders’ accesses to the different web parts (activities, e-learning courses, course categories) with reference to time. For this purpose, a multinomial logit model is used. The contribution of the presented methodology consists of data preparation and data modeling. The data preparation is a methodology design and recommendations for acquiring reliable data from the log files of the VLE and in the data modeling, the chapter brings a detailed model description and methodology for modeling stakeholders’ behavior with reference to time. Moreover, the description of the possibilities for use of the obtained knowledge may also represent a valuable part of this chapter.},

The environment, iSocial, is being developed to help youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) develop social competencies. The approach to identifying, classifying and coding behavior in the 3D VLE uses an adaptation of reciprocal interaction coding methods traditionally used in single-subject research with individuals with ASD. These adaptations consider the unique characteristics of the 3D VLE technology and the nature and context of learning in this type of environment. A description of the coding methods employed is provided. Selected results are presented to illustrate how this methodology can offer detailed descriptions of learning and social interaction behavior in context. Such results demonstrate the potential of this approach for building new knowledge about how learning takes place and progresses in a 3D VLE and for making data-driven design decisions for improving the learning experience in the online social context.},

While established Learning Analytics methods use Web interaction to evaluate learner engagement, there is uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of these measures. In this paper we propose a method for evaluating pedagogical activity in Web-based comments using a pedagogical framework, and present a preliminary study that assigns a Pedagogical Value (PV) to comments. This has value as it categorises discussion in terms of pedagogical activity rather than Web interaction. Results show that PV is distinct from typical interactional measures, there are negative or insignificant correlations with established Learning Analytics methods, but strong correlations with relevant linguistic indicators of learning, suggesting that the use of pedagogical frameworks may produce more accurate indicators than interaction analysis, and that linguistic rather than interaction analysis has the potential to automatically identify learning behaviour.},

In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics.},

The data from their participation were recorded, quantified and compared with their resulting grades on exams to ascertain to what degree measures of student participation were related to student learning. These measures of student participation were augmented by data from the university's student information system, which provided background information. Data was also collected from a number of surveys administered over the semester. Analyses of the data revealed some strong relationships between grades and the degree and quality of student participation. Moreover the behavior of students varied significantly when stratified by their incoming GPA. The empirical relationships reported here provide evidence-based affirmation that student participation is related to learning and suggests that the strength of GPA as a predictor of grades may be due more to a lack the study skills and/or motivation rather than cognitive ability.},

Through this approach, we show how textual reporting is a coherent way of providing information that can complement (and even enhance) visual statistics and help teachers to understand in a comprehensible manner the behavior of their students during the course. This solution extracts relevant information from the students' activity and encodes it into intermediate descriptions using linguistic variables and temporal references, which are subsequently translated into texts in natural language. The examples of application on real data from an undergraduate course supported by the Soft Learn platform show that automatic textual reporting is a valuable complementary tool for explaining teachers and learners the information comprised in a Learning Analytics Dashboard.},
