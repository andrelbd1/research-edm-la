	abstract = {Abstract The aim of this paper is to explore students' behavior and interaction patterns in different types of online quiz-based activities within learning management systems (LMS). Analyzing students' behavior in online learning activities and detecting specific patterns of interaction in \{LMS\} is a topic of great interest for the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) research communities. Previous studies have focused primarily on frequency analysis without addressing the temporal aspects of students' learning behavior. Therefore, we apply a process-oriented approach, investigating perspectives on using process mining methods in the context of online learning and assessment. To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students' interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings. Using process mining methods, we identify specific types of interaction sequences that shed new light on students’ quiz-taking strategies in LMS. We believe that these findings bring important implications for researchers studying student behavior in online environments as well as practitioners using online quizzes for learning and assessment.},

However, with a distance methodology, these observations are not possible. When forums are created they are intended to discuss particular topics. It is relevant to monitor that the topics discussed are the intended ones in order to achieve course objectives. To tackle this shortcoming, our work studies the dynamics of relevant topics in on-line asynchronous discussion forums, and this is done by analyzing the large amount of students’ interactions generated in the forums of our Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we analyze the students’ behavior patterns in the forums of a distance subject, and characterize the relevant topics and subtopics from the forums’ messages belonging to two academic years. From the statistical and graphical results obtained, a set of valuable recommendations are also given.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, as information technology has become more prevalent, learning management systems have arisen around e-learning and web-based platforms. As a result, huge quantities of data about students’ learning process have been recorded and stored. Teachers can apply data-mining techniques to mine students’ learning performance. One such technique is association rule mining, which can find correlations between student characteristics and performance. For instance, a rule (Attendance = Middle) ∧ (Gender = Male) → (Semester = Low) indicates that the semester grade of students is at the Low level if their gender is Male and attendance rate is Middle, where Low and Middle are predetermined linguistic terms given by teachers. Teachers can rely on such rules to formulate their teaching strategies. However, these rules may be varied in different semesters because of the change of student characteristics or teaching method of teachers. The above rule is used to describe student behavior during the last semester, yet, within this semester, the rule changes to (Attendance = Low) ∧ (Gender = Female) → (Semester = Low). Without updating this knowledge, teachers might adopt inappropriate teaching strategies for students who are learning in different ways across different semesters. In this study, we propose a new change mining model to discover the change in student learning performance and characteristics on the basis of association rules. We conducted experiments with real-life datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The learning behaviors of students attending remote video lectures are assessed by logging their behavior and analyzing the resulting multimedia data using machine learning algorithms.

Some faces, eyes, and status of eyes are extracted from video stream taken from a webcam using this module. The extracted information is saved in a dataset for further analysis.

This study proposes a TAM3-based model – with the inclusion of two additional variables: personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology and perceived interaction – to study the factors influencing the acceptance of e-learning systems. Attention is also brought towards the role of behavioral intention, especially in its relation with use behavior. In order to do so, two different settings were considered: higher education and lifelong learning; data was gathered from a survey administrated to Spanish graduate and lifelong learning students, and partial least squares analysis was used to test the research model. Results supported \{TAM\} relations, except for the intention-behavior linkage, and unveiled a dual nature of perceived usefulness – with one component related to efficiency and performance, and another component related to flexibility.

This paper focuses on the improvement of e-learning services on Moodle with limited system resources. The course design and Moodle management were improved as follows after some workarounds: (1) The “Final Test,” which is a JavaScript-based test inside the Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) content was divided into a Moodle quiz module. “Conditional Activities” were then adopted to allow users to take the “Final Test” after the completion of the \{SCORM\} content. (2) The course was reset annually to delete all \{SCORM\} tracking data. In this study, we obtain effective operational findings for developing robust e-learning services, particularly for Moodle. As a result, we can provided robust e-learning services in Japan because GakuNinMoodle and the security awareness education course for federated institute, “Learn with Princess Rin Rin: Cyberethics” are accessed by 102 institutes including Kyoto University, Gunma University, and National Institute of Technology through actual operations. In general, database optimization is the best method for improving \{LMS\} performance with limited system resources. Specifically, online courses that include \{SCORM\} content should be considered as an overhead of \{API\} calls between \{LMS\} and \{SCORM\} content to determine a temporary solution under the constraint of limited resources to improve the performance of \{LMS\} when numerous accesses and downloads of learning reports are requested. Therefore, robust e-learning services with Moodle can be obtained even with limited resources. Additional research is being conducted to analyze learning records and system logs to improve the contents according to the assumption that the best method to improve e-learning is by considering learner's behavior.},

Mining of \{LMS\} users’ data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way \{LMS\} users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the \{LMS\} use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle \{LMS\} users’ QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts’ contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the \{LMS\} use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of \{HEIs\} could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess \{OLEs\} stakeholders’ needs within the teaching and learning practices.},

Previous studies generally focus on the construction of predictors for learner performance evaluation after a course has ended, and neglect the practical value of an “early warning” system to predict at-risk students while a course is in progress. We collected the complete learning activities of an online undergraduate course and applied data-mining techniques to develop an early warning system. Our results showed that, time-dependent variables extracted from \{LMS\} are critical factors for online learning. After students have used an \{LMS\} for a period of time, our early warning system effectively characterizes their current learning performance. Data-mining techniques are useful in the construction of early warning systems; based on our experimental results, classification and regression tree (CART), supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifier for the evaluation of learning performance investigated by this study.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The augmented complex LMS (ACLMS) algorithm deals with second order noncircular (improper) input signals, based on widely linear modelling and the use of full second order statistical information. In current analyses of ACLMS, it is implicitly or explicitly assumed that the length of the adaptive filter is equal to that of the unknown system’s impulse response (optimal model order). In many applications, however, the length of the adaptive filter is smaller than required, the so called deficient length case, which renders the analysis for a ‘sufficient length’ ACLMS inadequate. To this end, we examine the statistical behaviour of the ACLMS algorithm in undermodelling situations. Exact expressions are developed to completely characterise both the transient and steady-state mean and mean square performances of the deficient length ACLMS for general second order noncircular Gaussian input signals. This is achieved using the recently introduced approximate uncorrelating transform (AUT), in order to jointly diagonalise the covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices with a single singular value decomposition (SVD), which both simplifies the analysis and enables a link between the degree of input noncircularity and the steady state mean square error (MSE) performance of the deficient length ACLMS. Simulations in system identification settings support the analysis.},

The Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm inherits slow convergence due to its dependency on the eigenvalue spread of the input correlation matrix. In this work, we resolve this problem by developing a novel variant of the LMS algorithms based on the q-derivative concept. The q-gradient is an extension of the classical gradient vector based on the concept of Jackson׳s derivative. Here, we propose to minimize the LMS cost function by employing the concept of q-derivative instead of the convent ional derivative. Thanks to the fact that the q-derivative takes larger steps in the search direction as it evaluates the secant of the cost function rather than the tangent (as in the case of a conventional derivative), we show that the q-derivative gives faster convergence for q \&gt; 1 when compared to the conventional derivative. Then, we present a thorough investigation of the convergence behavior of the proposed q-LMS algorithm and carry out different analyses to assess its performance. Consequently, new explicit closed-form expressions for the mean-square-error (MSE) behavior are derived. Simulation results are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings.},

There a closed-form solution can be determined for any colouring of the input signal and the additive noise.

Here another particular problem is analyzed: the long filter, i.e. a tapped-delay line structure with a large number of taps. For the limiting case of an infinitely long filter, exact closed-form solutions are derived for the steady-state weight-error correlations and the associated “misadjustment”, again valid for any colouring of the input signal and the additive noise, and now also for any stepsize guaranteeing stability.

The analysis is based upon a feedback approach, with a forward branch generating the above-mentioned solution for vanishing stepsize and a peculiar feedback branch responsible for higher-order corrections. As in any feedback structure, instability can occur beyond a critical value of the feedback parameter. In our case an experimentally supported maximum stepsize is found, beyond which spontaneous oscillations might occur.},

A novel analytical result which describes the learning behavior of the RI algorithm is obtained. It is shown that within limits of approximation, the excess mean-square-error (MSE) of the algorithm approaches zero and the RI algorithm converges to a lower steady-state MSE than the LMS algorithm. The results show that the theoretical and experimental MSE curves of the RI algorithm are in agreement.

Many practical problems in the filed of distributed estimation happen to be multi-task oriented. Without prior knowledge of clustering structure, i.e. nodes do not know which clusters they belong to beforehand, distributed algorithms for parameter estimation have received great attention in recent years. In most previous work, each node collaborates with all its neighboring nodes at each iteration, which introduces unnecessary communication assumption when any node cooperates with neighboring nodes from different clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-reducing diffusion LMS (Least-Mean-Square) algorithm, called the CR-dLMS algorithm, for estimating true parameters in multi-task environment. Under the CR-dLMS algorithm, we control the probabilities of data fusion from neighboring nodes by minimizing mean-square-deviation (MSD) to reduce communication cost among nodes. Theoretical analysis for the learning behavior of the CR-dLMS algorithm is performed, and simulation results show that the CR-dLMS algorithm can indeed achieve the same estimation performance as several other previous algorithms while great reducing the communication cost among nodes.},

Hearing aids are essential devices for social integration of hearing impaired people in order to improve their auditory perception. Recent studies have reported significant dissatisfaction factors that tend to reduce their daily use. The occlusion effect is one important source of complaints. This phenomenon stems from the partial or complete closure of the ventilation opening of the ear-mould, usually performed to prevent feedback effects in high-gain devices. This work presents a new adaptive active-noise-control system to reduce the occlusion effect in small- or unvented hearing aids. In contrast to previously developed occlusion-effect cancellers, this system offers a feedforward cancelling structure that permits the analysis of its behaviour as a finite-impulse-response linear-filter identification problem. Deterministic recursive equations were derived with the aim to theoretically predict its mean square error and mean coefficient behaviour, both in transient and steady state conditions. Such models are of particular interest to hearing aid designers as guide tools for setting parameters to obtain a desired performance. Computational simulations accurately agree with theoretical predictions obtained by the derived equations, indicating a mean reduction of 5.4 dB of the occlusion effect in the range of 200–500 Hz. Subjective experiments with the use of a real prototype corroborate the functionality of the proposed architecture. No perceptual side effects regarding high-frequency amplifications of the original sounds were reported by volunteers.},

It is found that the step-size bound and transient behavior of the LMS and the steady-state MSD of the NLMS depend on the kurtosis of the input signal. Convergence rates and steady-state MSDs of the two algorithms are then compared, which shows that the normalized variant with a large step-size would offer faster convergence rate than the LMS scheme. However, when small step-sizes are employed, the LMS achieves lower steady-state MSD than the NLMS at the same convergence rate.},

A method relying on the convex combination of two normalized filtered-s least mean square algorithms (CNFSLMS) is presented for nonlinear active noise control (ANC) systems with a linear secondary path (LSP) and nonlinear secondary path (NSP) in this paper. The proposed CNFSLMS algorithm-based functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) filter, aiming to overcome the compromise between convergence speed and steady state mean square error of the NFSLMS algorithm, offers both fast convergence rate and low steady state error. Furthermore, by replacing the sigmoid function with the modified Versorial function, the modified CNFSLMS (MCNFSLMS) algorithm with low computational complexity is also presented. Experimental results illustrate that the combination scheme can behave as well as the best component and even better. Moreover, the MCNFSLMS algorithm requires less computational complexity than the CNFSLMS while keeping the same filtering performance.},

Statistical inference subject to nonnegativity constraints is a frequently occurring problem in learning problems. The nonnegative least-mean-square (NNLMS) algorithm was derived to address such problems in an online way. This algorithm builds on a fixed-point iteration strategy driven by the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. It was shown to provide low variance estimates, but it however suffers from unbalanced convergence rates of these estimates. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a variant of the NNLMS algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of its behavior in terms of transient learning curve, steady-state and tracking performance. We also introduce an extension of the algorithm for online sparse system identification. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and to validate the theoretical results.},

This paper analyzes the convergence behavior of the algorithm by using the theory of asymptotically equivalent matrices. The eigenvalues of the matrix controlling the convergence behavior is proven to have the tendency to be equally distributed, and a theoretical eigenvalue spread is derived based on the first-order autoregressive (AR) signal model, which is significantly lower than that of the time domain LMS (TDLMS) algorithm.

The model-free hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method for structural health monitoring (SHM) has significant advantages over the traditional model-based SHM methods that require a suitable baseline model to represent the actual system response. This paper provides a unique validation against both an experimental reinforced concrete (RC) building and a calibrated numerical model to delineate the capability of the model-free HLA method and the adaptive least mean squares (LMS) model-based method in detecting, localizing and quantifying damage that may not be visible, observable in overall structural response. Results clearly show the model-free HLA method is capable of adapting to changes in how structures transfer load or demand across structural elements over time and multiple events of different size. However, the adaptive LMS model-based method presented an image of greater spread of lesser damage over time and story when the baseline model is not well defined. Finally, the two algorithms are tested over a simpler hysteretic behaviour typical steel structure to quantify the impact of model mismatch between the baseline model used for identification and the actual response. The overall results highlight the need for model-based methods to have an appropriate model that can capture the observed response, in order to yield accurate results, even in small events where the structure remains linear.},

Good performances of this algorithm have been shown for non-Gaussian additive measurement noise. However, the complexity of the algorithm imposes difficulties for the development of a reasonably complete theoretical stochastic model for its behavior. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the development of such a model. We study the stochastic behavior of Least Mean Kurtosis (LMK) algorithm for Gaussian inputs and for additive noises with even probability density functions. Deterministic recursions are derived for the adaptive weight error covariance matrix in a very novel manner, leading to a recursive model for the excess mean square error (EMSE) behavior that is shown to be accurate for Gaussian, uniform and binary noise distributions. The analysis results are then used to compare the performances of LMK with the least mean squares (LMS) and least mean fourth (LMF) algorithms under different circumstances.},

In narrowband active noise control (NANC) systems, several modifications of the well-known filtered-x least-mean-square (FXLMS) algorithm have been proposed for improved operation. The filtered-x weighted accumulated LMS (FXWALMS) algorithm is a variant of the FXLMS algorithm obtained by introducing the momentum LMS (MLMS) algorithm into the conventional FXLMS algorithm. The version with momentum term of the adaptive algorithm is used in practical implementations aiming to increase convergence with moderate computational cost. In order to better understand the influence of the FXWALMS algorithm on the NANC system, statistical performance of such an algorithm is investigated in both the transient and steady-state behaviors. Different equations which describe the convergence behaviors of the mean and mean squared estimation errors for the discrete Fourier coefficients (DFCs) of the secondary source are derived and discussed in detail. Using related difference equations, the steady-state expressions for DFCs estimation mean square error and the residual noise mean square error are developed in closed forms. Moreover, a modified FXWALMS (MFXWALMS) algorithm is proposed to improve the overall performance of the system. Extensive simulations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of analytical results and the superior performance of the MFXWALMS algorithm in various scenarios.},

The Fractional Tap-length Normalized Least Mean-Square (FT-NLMS) adaptive algorithm, a member of the variable tap-length LMS algorithms family, has attracted attention recently due to its robustness and low computational complexity compared with existing variable tap-length algorithms. The parameter Δ in the FT-NLMS algorithm controls convergence speed and bias from the optimum tap-length, which necessitates a compromise between them due to its fixed value. Therefore, a well adjusted time-varying Δ ( n ) can provide both fast convergence speed and small steady state bias. In this paper, a new robust variable Δ ( n ) FT-NLMS is proposed that ensures a large value of Δ ( n ) when the algorithm is far from the optimum with Δ ( n ) decreasing as the adaptive filter approaches the optimum even in the presence of uncorrelated noise disturbance. Transient and steady state performance analysis of the proposed algorithm will be presented, where expressions for the algorithm steady state excess Mean-Square Error (MSE), steady state tap-length of the adaptive filter, and steady state E \{ Δ ( ∞ ) \} are derived. Simulation examples are presented in different experimental conditions, which will demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing variable tap-length NLMS algorithms. Moreover, simulation results will show that the derived theoretical expressions can predict very well the actual behavior of the proposed algorithm.},

Multi combination allows each node to use information from non-adjacent nodes at each time instant, thereby reducing steady-state error. We analyzed the output to derive stability conditions and to quantify the transient and steady-state behaviors.

Feedback cancellation in a hearing aid is essential for achieving high maximum stable gain to compensate for the losses in severe to profound hearing impaired people. The performance of adaptive feedback cancellers has been studied by assuming that the feedback path can be modeled as a linear system. However, limited dynamic range, low-cost loudspeakers, and nonlinear power amplifiers may distort the hearing aid output signal. In this way, linear-based predictions of the canceller performance may lead to significant deviations from its actual behavior. This work presents a theoretical performance analysis of a Least Mean Square based shadow filter that is applied to set up the coefficients of a feedback canceller, which is subject to a static saturation type nonlinearity at the output of the direct path. Deterministic recursive equations are derived to predict the mean square feedback error and the mean coefficient vector evolution between updates of the feedback canceller. These models are defined as functions of the canceller parameters and input signal statistics. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations show the provided models are highly accurate under the considered assumptions. The developed models allow inferences about the potential impact of an overdriven loudspeaker over the transient performance of the direct method feedback canceller, serving as insightful tools for understanding the involved mechanisms.},

Adaptive networks are well suited to perform distributed estimation task where the observations collected by nodes of a network are used to estimate a common network-wide desired parameter. Although the benefits of cooperation are clear for the networks with ideal links, in the presence of noisy links their behavior changes considerably. Thus, it is important to analyze, in this case, when and to what extent the cooperation improves the estimation performance. In this paper, we study the influence of noisy links on the effectiveness of cooperation for two important types of adaptive networks, i.e. incremental LMS adaptive network (ILMS) and diffusion LMS (DLMS). We first define the concept of cooperation gain and compute it for the ILMS and the DLMS algorithms with ideal and noisy links. We show that when the links are ideal, both ILMS and DLMS algorithms provide increased performance in comparison with the non-cooperative solution. On the other hand, in the presence of noisy links, the cooperation gain is not always influential, and based on the channel and data statistics, for some values of step-size, a non-cooperative scheme outperforms the ILMS and DLMS algorithms. We present some simulation results to clarify the discussions.},

Commercial claims for LED-based products in terms of lumen maintenance are fully based on TM-21 extrapolations using LM-80 data. This paper indicates that there may be a risk in doing this as TM-21 only relies on the behavior of the average LED degradation, instead of taking into account the degradation of all individual LEDs. Therefore, we propose a more profound statistical analysis in order to make the appropriate step from TM-21 extrapolation to lumen maintenance on a product level. This is needed as some commercial claims are based on 10 years of warranty and some service bids provide periods of 20 to 25 years of operation. This paper reviews the different approaches currently available to perform lumen maintenance extrapolations. We propose a new method to analyze and extrapolate LM-80 data using a more profound statistical approach.},

The null steering algorithms with single and multiple constraints (NSASC, NSAMC) were proposed by the authors. With NSASC/NSAMC, the null positions can be selectively tracked one after another without affecting other null positions so that the interference signals can be rejected while the desired signal is concentrated by the array. The main advantage of NSASC/NSAMC is the simplicity. When compared with conventional LMS based linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming algorithm, NSASC and NSAMC converge in a faster manner; and compared with QR-RLS based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, NSASC and NSAMC have lower complexity. Furthermore, due to their cascade configurations, the signal self-nulling problem for conventional beamformer can be resolved by using NSASC/NSAMC. This paper provides further analysis and additional investigation on the convergence behavior, rules for sidelobe direction selection, ratio parameter and the effect of number of elements for NSASC/NSAMC.},

The thrust of research and implementation in this field is mainly powered by the use of the well-known mean-square cost function upon which relies the ubiquitous least-mean square (LMS) algorithm. However, such an algorithm is well-known to lead to sub-optimal solutions in the real world that is largely dominated by non-Gaussian interference signals. The use of a non-mean-square cost function would successfully tackle these types of interference signals but would invariably involve a higher computational cost. To address these important practical issues, this paper proposes a new adaptive equalization technique that combines both the least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm, which is governed by a non-mean-square cost function, with a power-of-two quantizer (PTQ) in the coefficient update process, which greatly reduces the computational cost involved and which therefore makes the proposed technique applicable to time-varying environments. This paper not only elaborates on the basic idea behind the proposed technique but also defines the necessary assumptions and provides a thorough statistical performance analysis (including a study of the convergence behavior) of the combined algorithm LMF-PTQ that is at the core of the proposed technique. An extensive simulation work was carried out and showed that the theoretical predictions are very well substantiated.},

In general, neural network training is a nonlinear multivariate optimisation problem. Unlike previous studies, in the present study, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and back-propagation (BP) algorithms were coupled to develop a robust hybrid training algorithm with both local and global search capabilities. To demonstrate the capacity of the proposed model, we applied the model to the predictions of the load–deformation behaviour of axially loaded piles. This is a soil–structure interaction problem, involving a complex mechanism of load transfer from the pile to the supporting geologic medium. A database of full scale pile loading tests is used to train and validate the product-unit network. The results show that the proposed hybrid learning algorithm simulates the load–deformation curve of axially loaded piles more accurately than other BP, PSO, and existing PSO–BP hybrid methods. The network developed using the proposed algorithm also turns out to be more accurate than hyperbolic and t − z models.},

But, for multimodal cost functions these procedures may lead to local minima, therefore, the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based procedures are considered as promising alternatives. In this paper we focus on a memetic algorithm based approach for training the multilayer perceptron NN applied to nonlinear system identification. The proposed memetic algorithm is an alternative to gradient search methods, such as back-propagation and back-propagation with momentum which has inherent limitations of many local optima. Here we have proposed the identification of a nonlinear system using memetic differential evolution (DE) algorithm and compared the results with other six algorithms such as Back-propagation (BP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm Back-propagation (GABP), Particle Swarm Optimization combined with Back-propagation (PSOBP). In the proposed system identification scheme, we have exploited DE to be hybridized with the back propagation algorithm, i.e. differential evolution back-propagation (DEBP) where the local search BP algorithm is used as an operator to DE. These algorithms have been tested on a standard benchmark problem for nonlinear system identification to prove their efficacy. First examples shows the comparison of different algorithms which proves that the proposed DEBP is having better identification capability in comparison to other. In example 2 good behavior of the identification method is tested on an one degree of freedom (1DOF) experimental aerodynamic test rig, a twin rotor multi-input–multi-output system (TRMS), finally it is applied to Box and Jenkins Gas furnace benchmark identification problem and its efficacy has been tested through correlation analysis.},

Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom.

	abstract = {E-learning has become an essential factor in the modern educational system. In today's diverse student population, E-learning must recognize the differences in student personalities to make the learning process more personalized. The objective of this study is to create a data model to identify both the student personality type and the dominant preference based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) theory. The proposed model utilizes data from student engagement with the learning management system (Moodle) and the social network, Facebook. The model helps students become aware of their personality, which in turn makes them more efficient in their study habits. The model also provides vital information for educators, equipping them with a better understanding of each student's personality. With this knowledge, educators will be more capable of matching students with their respective learning styles. The proposed model was applied on a sample data collected from the Business College at the German university in Cairo, Egypt (240 students). The model was tested using 10 data mining classification algorithms which were NaiveBayes, BayesNet, Kstar, Random forest, J48, OneR, JRIP, KNN /IBK, RandomTree, Decision Table. The results showed that OneR had the best accuracy percentage of 97.40\%, followed by Random forest 93.23\% and J48 92.19\%.},
