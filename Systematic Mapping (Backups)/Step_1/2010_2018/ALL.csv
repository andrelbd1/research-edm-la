The challenges regularly faced by teaching librarians include poor student attendance at elective sessions, trying to facilitate active learning with large classes, low student motivation and poor engagement, trying to find effective ways of using a {VLE} to support learning activities, dealing with adult learners, and trying to create meaningful learning experiences within ‘one-shot’ class sessions.","2011","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-21 11:59:30","","121 - 147","","","","","","","Chandos Information Professional Series","","","","Chandos Publishing","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-1-84334-629-6.50004-2","","","","active learning; adult learners; confidence challenge; one-shot classes; student motivation; virtual learning environment","","McGuinness, Claire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DED5N83Q","bookSection","2017","Piovesan, A.; Griffor, E.","7 - Reasoning About Safety and Security: The Logic of Assurance","Handbook of System Safety and Security","978-0-12-803773-7","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128037737000073","Abstract A common definition of assurance is certainty about something. Assurance has synonyms like guarantee, certainty, certitude, surety, confidence, expectation and antonyms like doubt and uncertainty. Since many of the systems that we design, build, and maintain have safety-critical or security-critical functions or both, we strive to provide assurance about these systems’ safety and security and perhaps also assurance of other characteristics. This chapter will outline the structure of reasoning about assurance of systems. Assurance is tasked with addressing both individual concerns and composite or compound concerns. Assurance demands that we analyze a system in order to identify risks and take steps in design and design process to mitigate or render “acceptable or reasonable” those risks. A case for the adequate assurance of a system, or an assurance case, consists of several distinct elements. It consists of requirements (asserting that the system has a set of assurance properties), test, design elements (with test results), and finally argumentation/reasoning about those requirements, tests, design elements, and test results. Aside from calling out this evidence and design artefacts, this argumentation may appeal to standards, regulations, and even expert opinion to justify the conclusion that this evidence is sufficient to assure us that the residual risk is “reasonable.” The key challenge to understanding the safety and security risks involved in designing, realizing, and deploying cyber-physical systems (CPS) is to understand and evaluate the argument for the acceptability or reasonableness of those risks. Safety has to do with the potential harm that can be caused by the system’s behaviors, while security has to do with the adverse impact that can occur as a result of unauthorized access or modification of the system. The behaviors of a system refer to how the system performs in the variety of operational settings. This is partially determined by the system design and partially by the everchanging environment in which the system operates. Certain intended behaviors are stated or described in the design and others are discovered in the course of conceiving of the system (identifying the requirements), constructing the system, and testing to determine whether the requirements are met (realization, including verification) and, finally, running the system in what we understand to be its operating environment (validation). An assurance case reasons about all of these activities, and their outcomes, and should provide us with a level of confidence that the system will perform as intended. An approach that emphasizes the work products of the design, verification, and validation activities forces us, in evaluating a system, to reconstruct the argument and even then there is currently no “gold standard” or “true north” against which to assess the reasoning used. Standards frequently strive to express or proscribe on the kind of reasoning and the consensus associated with standard is itself compelling evidence that those proscriptions are sound. Standards frequently describe conceptualization, realization, and assurance activities that need be performed but only implicitly in the dictates of the standards and not through explicit descriptions of the argument itself. In this chapter we will review an approach to safety or security assurance that clearly distinguishes the nature of assurance reasoning. We do this by means of an example of a safety concern, functional, or software safety for automotive systems, and with reference to a specific standard, {ISO} 26262. Though this discussion focuses on an aspect of safety, much of the analysis of assurance reasoning is general and common to the assurance of any system with respect to a variety of other concerns. The extension of these methods to general {CPS} or the Internet of Things (IoT) will be taken up in future publications. In the annex we provide a graphic representation of the general safety case strategy for electronic throttle control.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","113 - 129","","","","","","","","","","","Syngress","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-803773-7.00007-3","","","","logic of judgements","","Griffor, Edward","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current delayed analysis processing in adaptive language learning systems is difficult to cope with the high-speed and high-volume data streams. To overcome this problem, we introduce a complex event processing (CEP) framework for an Adaptive Language Learning System. The system consists of an event adapter sub-system that can process various inputs such as voice, video, text and other interaction events. The event adapter extracts relevant data to support the operational events module, the learning activity events module and the learner knowledge space events module. These three modules in the event hierarchies provide support to the learner adaptation and learner visual analytics modules. In this study, we conduct three simulations to evaluate the initialization time, delay time and throughput of the proposed system. Each of the experiments simulates 1000 learners and 1000 rules and generates 10 events per second. The results indicate the {CEP} framework is efficient with a processing delay of less than 1 . 2 μ s and throughput of 80,000 events per second. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications and suggest ideas for future research.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stream processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A prior ownership state is affected by prediction of the effects of a prepared action, and exerts control by strengthening or suppressing actual execution of the action. A retrospective ownership state depends on whether the sensed consequences of an executed action co-occur with the predicted consequences, and is the basis for acknowledging authorship of actions, for example, in social context. It is shown how a number of known phenomena can occur. For example, scenarios were shown for vetoing a prepared action due to unsatisfactory predicted effects, and for mirroring an observed action performed by another agent, without imitating the action. Moreover, it is shown how poor action effect prediction capabilities can lead to reduced retrospective ownership states, as in persons suffering from schizophrenia. The obtained computational model can be used as a basis for simulation-based training, for example, to develop a virtual patient based on the model so that a psychiatrist or psycho-therapist (e.g., during his or her education) can gain insight in the processes in certain types of patients, or to analyse how effective a certain form of therapy can be. A second type of application is in the area of gaming or virtual stories in which, for example, persons with deviations in ownership states play a role and based on that show unexpected behaviour.","2012","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","54 - 67","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Attribution of actions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A lot of experience is available which provides useful recommendations leading to reasonable efficiency of broiler houses. Trying different alternatives in practice is, or course, very expensive. For this reason, computer simulation becomes an extremely useful tool. Presently, standard computers make it possible to build and run simulation models in which each broiler is considered as a single “particle” whose behavior is subject to the interaction with other broilers and the environment. The objective of this paper is to introduce, discuss, and analyze a new computational model, that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of this type. The model considers the displacements of the chickens as being analogous to the motion of physico-chemical particles (atoms or molecules), relying on Langevin dynamics and taking temperature, air speed, humidity, house dimensions, chicken population, availability of eaters, and water drinking systems into consideration. The parameters of our model were tunned both using extreme and standard assumptions on the behavior of chickens in a broiler house.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","1 - 14","","","141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Explosive of {ICT} has changed the learning ecosystem landscape, nurturing social approach and learning becoming more socialized. However, e-learning tend to used individualistic approach caused seclusion and engaging the learners become an obstacle for e-learning. Focusing in on solely on technology or content aspect cannot be the factor to attracting the learners to engaging in e-learning. The aims of this research to study possible components of participatory engagement to influence the process of engagement in e-learning community based on participatory learning theory. The conceptual model is integration of individual or group of learners, collaborative leaning and highlights the importance of interaction of learners and educators in facilitating each other to engage in e-learning community. Hence, this research identifying participatory engagement component within the e-learning community are essentials in stimulating a strong and sustainable e-learning community. It can be done by incorporating participatory learning model into the e-learning community to enhance engagement which much needed in e-learning community. The introduction of participatory engagement components helps in fostering engagement within the e-learning community. The research employed systematic analysis by framing urgency of the problem based on relevant journal accordingly of the relevant work, summarize information gathered and finally interpreted the information. Based on the information summarized, it is critical and extremely valuable to e-learning community empower by learner through interaction of learners for sustained e-learning community, besides educator – learner interaction as facilitator.

The null steering algorithms with single and multiple constraints (NSASC, NSAMC) were proposed by the authors. With NSASC/NSAMC, the null positions can be selectively tracked one after another without affecting other null positions so that the interference signals can be rejected while the desired signal is concentrated by the array. The main advantage of NSASC/NSAMC is the simplicity. When compared with conventional LMS based linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming algorithm, NSASC and NSAMC converge in a faster manner; and compared with QR-RLS based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, NSASC and NSAMC have lower complexity. Furthermore, due to their cascade configurations, the signal self-nulling problem for conventional beamformer can be resolved by using NSASC/NSAMC. This paper provides further analysis and additional investigation on the convergence behavior, rules for sidelobe direction selection, ratio parameter and the effect of number of elements for NSASC/NSAMC.","2010-05","2018-02-21 12:52:46","2018-02-21 12:52:46","","1530-1541","","5","90","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive array; Array processing; Beamforming; Constrained null steering algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address the relation between the cerebellum and internal models, we adopt the chip metaphor that has been used to represent the combination of a homogeneous cerebellar cortical microcircuit with individual microzones having unique external connections. This metaphor indicates that identifying the function of a particular cerebellar chip requires knowledge of both the general microcircuit algorithm and the chip’s individual connections. Here we use a popular candidate algorithm as embodied in the adaptive filter, which learns to decorrelate its inputs from a reference (‘teaching’, ‘error’) signal. This algorithm is computationally powerful enough to be used in a very wide variety of engineering applications. However, the crucial issue is whether the external connectivity required by such applications can be implemented biologically. We argue that some applications appear to be in principle biologically implausible: these include the Smith predictor and Kalman filter (for state estimation), and the feedback–error–learning scheme for adaptive inverse control. However, even for plausible schemes, such as forward models for noise cancellation and novelty-detection, and the recurrent architecture for adaptive inverse control, there is unlikely to be a simple mapping between microzone function and internal model structure. This initial analysis suggests that cerebellar involvement in particular behaviours is therefore unlikely to have a neat classification into categories such as ‘forward model’. It is more likely that cerebellar microzones learn a task-specific adaptive-filter operation which combines a number of signal-processing roles.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","134 - 149","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We participated in 30 dance sessions in schools to study human–human interaction between children and a human dance teacher, and to identify the applied methodologies. Based on the strategies observed, both social and task-dependent, we implemented a robotic system capable of autonomously instructing dance sequences to children while displaying basic social cues to engage the child in the task. Experiments were performed in a hospital with the Nao robot interacting with 12 children through multiple encounters, when possible (18 sessions, 236 min). Observational analysis through video recordings and survey evaluations were used to assess the quality of interaction. Moreover, we introduce an involvement measure based on the aggregation of observed behavioral cues to assess the level of interest in the interaction through time. The analysis revealed high levels of involvement, while highlighting the need for further research into social engagement and adaptation with robots over repeated sessions.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","707 - 720","","6","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Involvement measure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current methods either fail to address the future behaviour and impact of stakeholders or they treat the role of stakeholders informally. We present a practical decision-analysis-based methodology for analysing stakeholder objectives and likely behaviour within contested unfolding futures. We address issues of power, interest, and commitment to achieve desired outcomes across a broad stakeholder constituency. Drawing on frameworks for corporate social responsibility (CSR), we provide an illustrative example of our approach to analyse a complex contested issue that crosses geographic, organisational and cultural boundaries. Whilst strategies can be developed by individual organisations that consider the interests of others – for example in consideration of an organisation's {CSR} agenda – we show that our augmentation of scenario method provides a further, nuanced, analysis of the power and objectives of all concerned stakeholders across a variety of unfolding futures.

Additionally, we distinguish between two types of online sexual self-disclosure: sexting within and outside of a romantic relationship. The results indicate that the extent to which adolescents hold positive attitudes towards the behavior and the extent to which they perceive that their peers approve of sexting, are associated with their engagement in sexting both within and outside of a romantic relationship, when controlling for age, gender, school track and internet use. Sexting outside of a romantic relationship was also influenced by the thrill that young people get out of engaging in this behavior. The discussion addresses the implications of these findings for prevention programs, practice and future research, such as the necessity for future studies to ask with whom participants have engaged in sexting.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","287 - 298","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sexual education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose To articulate a theoretical framework of sensemaking in diabetes self-management that integrates existing scholarship with empirical data. Methods The proposed framework is grounded in theories of sensemaking adopted from organizational behavior, education, and human–computer interaction. To empirically validate the framework the researchers reviewed and analyzed reports on qualitative studies of diabetes self-management practices published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2015. Results The proposed framework distinguishes between sensemaking and habitual modes of self-management and identifies three essential sensemaking activities: perception of new information related to health and wellness, development of inferences that inform selection of actions, and carrying out daily activities in response to new information. The analysis of qualitative findings from 50 published reports provided ample empirical evidence for the proposed framework; however, it also identified a number of barriers to engaging in sensemaking in diabetes self-management. Conclusions The proposed framework suggests new directions for research in diabetes self-management and for design of new informatics interventions for data-driven self-management.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:46","2018-02-06 16:58:46","","406 - 417","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, ePHRs are not yet widely used by consumers. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been successfully used to explain health related behaviours among chronic disease patients. In addition, Information Systems (IS) theories such as Task Technology Fit (TTF) have been successfully used to explain information technology adoption. This study leverages these theories along with the health self-management readiness concept of the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) to propose a theoretical model of ePHR adoption by chronic disease patients for the task of self-management. The role of educational interventions on various elements of the proposed model is also examined. A survey-based study of 230 Type 2 Diabetes patients is used to empirically validate the proposed model via structural equation modeling techniques. Results reveal that the PMT, {TTF} and {PAM} constructs all have significant direct and indirect effects on the intention to adopt an ePHR. In addition, the educational intervention analysis indicates that the provision of advanced ePHR education positively influences various constructs in the model, while the use of fear appeals does not have an effect.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","256 - 272","","","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adoption intention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate ease of use, the treatment was delivered via the Internet (Internet CBT; iCBT). Eleven participants with at least mild symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) total scores &gt; 4 ) or anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) total scores &gt; 4 ) accessed the online Arab Wellbeing Course, which consisted of five online lessons delivered over 8 weeks. Measures of depression, anxiety, distress and disability were gathered at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Data were analysed using mixed-linear model analyses. Ninety-one percent (10/11) of participants completed the five lessons over 8 weeks, with 10/11 providing post-treatment and 3-month follow-up data. Participants improved significantly across all outcome measures, with large within-group effect sizes based on estimated marginal means (Cohen's d) at post-treatment (d = 1.08 to 1.74) and 3-month follow-up (d = 1.53 to 2.00). The therapist spent an average of 90.72 min (SD = 28.98) in contact, in total, with participants during the trial. Participants rated the Arab Wellbeing Course as acceptable. Caution is needed in interpreting the results of the current study given the small sample size employed, raising questions about the impact of levels of acculturation and the absence of a control group. However, the results are encouraging and indicate that, with minor modifications, western psychological interventions have the potential to be of benefit to English speaking Arab immigrants.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:22","2018-02-06 16:58:22","","32 - 38","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Transdiagnostic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have reported significant dissatisfaction factors that tend to reduce their daily use. The occlusion effect is one important source of complaints. This phenomenon stems from the partial or complete closure of the ventilation opening of the ear-mould, usually performed to prevent feedback effects in high-gain devices. This work presents a new adaptive active-noise-control system to reduce the occlusion effect in small- or unvented hearing aids. In contrast to previously developed occlusion-effect cancellers, this system offers a feedforward cancelling structure that permits the analysis of its behaviour as a finite-impulse-response linear-filter identification problem. Deterministic recursive equations were derived with the aim to theoretically predict its mean square error and mean coefficient behaviour, both in transient and steady state conditions. Such models are of particular interest to hearing aid designers as guide tools for setting parameters to obtain a desired performance. Computational simulations accurately agree with theoretical predictions obtained by the derived equations, indicating a mean reduction of 5.4 dB of the occlusion effect in the range of 200–500 Hz. Subjective experiments with the use of a real prototype corroborate the functionality of the proposed architecture. No perceptual side effects regarding high-frequency amplifications of the original sounds were reported by volunteers.","2016-12-01","2018-02-21 12:52:32","2018-02-21 12:52:32","","266-275","","","79","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Active noise reduction; Adaptive filter; Hearing aids; LMS; Occlusion effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The filtered-x weighted accumulated LMS (FXWALMS) algorithm is a variant of the FXLMS algorithm obtained by introducing the momentum LMS (MLMS) algorithm into the conventional FXLMS algorithm. The version with momentum term of the adaptive algorithm is used in practical implementations aiming to increase convergence with moderate computational cost. In order to better understand the influence of the FXWALMS algorithm on the NANC system, statistical performance of such an algorithm is investigated in both the transient and steady-state behaviors. Different equations which describe the convergence behaviors of the mean and mean squared estimation errors for the discrete Fourier coefficients (DFCs) of the secondary source are derived and discussed in detail. Using related difference equations, the steady-state expressions for DFCs estimation mean square error and the residual noise mean square error are developed in closed forms. Moreover, a modified FXWALMS (MFXWALMS) algorithm is proposed to improve the overall performance of the system. Extensive simulations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of analytical results and the superior performance of the MFXWALMS algorithm in various scenarios.","2014-11","2018-02-21 12:52:38","2018-02-21 12:52:38","","296-310","","","104","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convergence; FXLMS; Mean square error (MSE); Narrowband active noise control (NANC); Performance analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our multi-GPU implementation uses a block-structured {MPI} parallelization and is suitable for load balancing and heterogeneous computations on {CPUs} and GPUs. The overhead required for multi-GPU simulations is discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that a large fraction of the kernel performance can be sustained for weak scaling on InfiniBand clusters, leading to excellent parallel efficiency. However, in strong scaling scenarios using multiple {GPUs} is much less efficient than running CPU-only simulations on {IBM} BG/P and x86-based clusters. Hence, a cost analysis must determine the best course of action for a particular simulation task and hardware configuration. Finally we present weak scaling results of heterogeneous simulations conducted on {CPUs} and {GPUs} simultaneously, using clusters equipped with varying node configurations.","2011","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","536 - 549","","9","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heterogeneous computations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agent-Based modeling has established itself as one of these tools. Though the major analytical principle remains the same – decomposition of the complex object into primitive particles, models themselves are fluctuating from the simple ones (e.g. spatial segregation models) to those able to propose reproduction of crowds, transport/pedestrian flows and other interactions by implementing sophisticated intelligent agent architectures. However, the utilization of agent-based modeling is not limited to satisfying sole scientific interest, but may be used for the resolution of applied issues as well. A polygon focused on performing both investigative and practical tasks has been introduced to simulate collective response to the changing environmental conditions (e.g. in the course of the natural disaster). The model originally designed to be incorporated into the mobile service computational infrastructure to constitute a massive mobile service for decision-making support is described throughout the paper.

The learning process is one of the activities on which emotions have a direct influence. Thus, understanding the manner in which emotions change the students’ learning process is not only very important but it can also allow to improve the existing learning models. Currently, in the majority of situations, the teacher serves as a facilitator between the student and the learning course, and through a constant analysis of the student’s behaviour, emotions and achievements, he constantly performs adjustments to the teaching process in order to meet the students’ needs and goals. Thus far, in online learning environments there is no easy way for teachers to analyse students’ behaviour and emotions. A possible solution to this problem can be the development of mechanisms that enable computers to automatically detect students’ emotions and adapt the learning process in order to meet students’ real needs. An emotional learning model was described and a software prototype was developed and tested, in order to find out whether it performs live identification of the students’ emotions, by using affective computing techniques, and whether it automatically performs adjustments to their individual learning process. Through a deeper analysis and multidisciplinary discussion of the achieved results it is possible to acknowledge that not only emotions impact students’ learning, but also that an application that performs live emotion recognition and which integrates this feature with adjustable online learning environments will trigger improvements in students’ learning.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","824 - 837","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","affective computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically the authors intend to fill gaps left by previous studies, include major finding, and assess the current state of the field related to the use of these innovative technologies. The results of this study are in line with previous studies suggesting higher cognitive gains and increases in positive affective toward learning from subjects using SEGs, SGs, and ES. Effects were calculated from 46 empirical experimental studies. The examined studies suggest that ES, SGs, and {SEGs} do not differ in a statistically significant way when compared to traditional instruction but do differ from each other.

Pressure force and torque are estimated with respect to the angular position of the gears, taking into account the phenomena that occur during the meshing course. In particular, the paper proposes a general methodology aiming at determining pressure force and torque components along the three coordinate axes and suitable to be applied on both spur and helical gear configuration. Firstly, the method to calculate pressure loads acting on a single tooth space during a complete revolution is given, then the total pressure force and torque loading each gear is obtained. Particular attention is addressed on the description of the helical gear scenario. As an example, the method is applied to a tandem gear pump, characterized by the presence of two stages, one with spur gears and one with helical gears. An experimentally assessed model to calculate the pressure ripple inside the tandem pump is described and the proposed procedure for pressure load estimation is applied. Eventually, the pressure loads estimated with the present procedure are compared with other estimation methods already described in the literature. The comparison shows that the present methodology is able to describe a wider range of phenomena involved in the meshing evolution and to determine all the pressure force and torque components applied to helical gears. The method gives suitable results to study the balancing and the dynamic behavior of gear pumps.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","265 - 282","","","76–77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NVH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research presented in this paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm based on knowledge map. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. Firstly, two hypotheses on e-learners’ different learning path preferences for four different learning scenarios (initial learning, usual review, pre-exam learning and pre-exam review) are verified through questionnaire-based statistical analysis. Secondly, according to learning behavior characteristics of four types of the learning scenarios, a multi-constraint learning path recommendation model is proposed, in which the variables and their weighted coefficients considers different learning path preferences of the learners in different learning scenarios as well as learning resource organization and fragmented time. Thirdly, based on the proposed model and knowledge map, the design and implementation of a multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm is described. Finally, it is shown that the questionnaire results from over 110 e-learners verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the similarity between the learners’ self-organized learning paths and the recommended learning paths.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","102 - 114","","","143","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Learning path recommendation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample was 340 teacher candidates reached through purposeful sampling. The study lasted a semester; students were involved in a blended learning environment where classroom lessons supported by self-regulatory e-tests as a part of an online course management system, called MOODLE. It was possible for students to take 10-item online quizzes and 20-item practice tests as many as they wanted. In the analysis, a factorial {ANOVA} design was applied. Findings indicated a moderate correlation between the number of formative e-tests taken and the perceived self-regulation levels, indicating higher perceived self-regulation levels as the number of formative e-tests increased. By using perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate, the gender differences in the number of e-tests taken were also investigated. According to finding, gender variable did not explain the differences in the compound variable “the number of formative e-tests”. However, after controlling for the effect of perceived self-regulation, the findings were significant. Hence, we can conclude that self-regulated behavior is independent of students' gender; therefore, e-assessments is a self-regulated, technology-based instructional aid in higher education.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:35","2018-02-06 16:58:35","","388 - 397","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gender differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recommender system is an E-Learning 3.0 software component that recommends new exercises to a student based on the actions (ratings) of previous learners. The affect recognizer analyze pictures of the student to recognize learning-centered emotions (frustration, boredom, engagement, and excitement) that are used to provide personalized instruction. Sentiment text analysis determines the quality of the programming exercises based on the opinions of the students. The authoring tool is used to create new exercises with no programming work. We conducted two evaluations: one evaluation used the Technology Acceptance Model to assess the impact of our software tool on student behavior. The second evaluation calculated the student’s t-test to assess the learning gain after a student used the tool.

The work of {UAV} operators is a key aspect to guarantee the success of this kind of tasks, and thus {UAV} operations are studied in many research fields, ranging from human factors to data analysis and machine learning. The present work aims to describe the behaviour of operators over time using a profile-based model where the evolution of the operator performance during a mission is the main unit of measure. In order to compare how different operators act throughout a mission, we describe a methodology based of multivariate-time series clustering to define and analyse a set of representative temporal performance profiles. The proposed methodology is applied in a multi-UAV simulation environment with inexperienced operators, obtaining a fair description of the temporal behavioural patterns followed during the course of the simulation.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","103 - 118","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Simulation-Based Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the benefits of cooperation are clear for the networks with ideal links, in the presence of noisy links their behavior changes considerably. Thus, it is important to analyze, in this case, when and to what extent the cooperation improves the estimation performance. In this paper, we study the influence of noisy links on the effectiveness of cooperation for two important types of adaptive networks, i.e. incremental LMS adaptive network (ILMS) and diffusion LMS (DLMS). We first define the concept of cooperation gain and compute it for the ILMS and the DLMS algorithms with ideal and noisy links. We show that when the links are ideal, both ILMS and DLMS algorithms provide increased performance in comparison with the non-cooperative solution. On the other hand, in the presence of noisy links, the cooperation gain is not always influential, and based on the channel and data statistics, for some values of step-size, a non-cooperative scheme outperforms the ILMS and DLMS algorithms. We present some simulation results to clarify the discussions.","2014-09","2018-02-21 12:52:44","2018-02-21 12:52:44","","858-864","","9","68","","AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive networks; Cooperation gain; diffusion; incremental; step-size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) are important pedagogical tools and a substantial amount of literature supports their role in personal, academic and professional development. However, achieving students’ acceptance of e-portfolios is still a challenge for higher education institutions. The model suggests that Attitude towards Behaviour (AB), Subjective Norms (SN) and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC) and their decomposed belief structure can assist in predicting and explaining students’ Behavioural Intention (BI) to use e-portfolios. After using e-portfolios, data was collected from 204 participants from a {UK} university and analysed through the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The results demonstrated that the proposed personal, social and control factors in the model were well supported statistically and significantly influenced e-portfolio acceptance. The study provides for the first time a proven theoretical model which can be used to predict e-portfolio acceptance. The findings are valuable for system developers, educational developers and higher education institutions where e-portfolios are being used.","2016","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","152 - 161","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-portfolio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method Standards, guidelines and recommendations on security and privacy best practices for staff personnel were identified using a systematic literature review. After a revision process, a questionnaire consisting of 27 questions was created and responded to by 180 health professionals from a public hospital. Results Weak passwords were reported by 62.2% of the respondents, 31.7% were unaware of the organization's procedures for discarding confidential information, and 19.4% did not carry out these procedures. Half of the respondents (51.7%) did not take measures to ensure that the personal health information on the computer monitor could not be seen by unauthorized individuals, and 57.8% were unaware of the procedure established to report a security violation. The correlation between the number of years in the position and good security practices was not significant (Pearson's r = 0.085, P = 0.254). Age was weakly correlated with good security practices (Pearson's r = −0.169, P = 0.028). A Mann–Whitney test showed no significant difference between the respondents’ security behavior as regards gender (U = 2536, P = 0.792, n = 178). The results of the study suggest that more efforts are required to improve security education for health personnel. Conclusions It was found that both preventive and corrective actions are needed to prevent health staff from causing security incidents. Healthcare organizations should: identify the types of information that require protection, clearly communicate the penalties that will be imposed, promote security training courses, and define what the organization considers improper behavior to be and communicate this to all personnel.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","454 - 467","","6","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Personal health information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing of the device revealed a significant and consistent change in its resistance subject to large tensile strains (&gt;45%). Some peculiar hysteresis effects of resistance response were observed during the course of characterization. To reveal underlying polymeric mechanisms, stress and resistance of bulk polymer nanocomposite samples were tested under various conditions. As a result, the resistance was found to be dependent on a number of factors such as stress, strain rate and strain history or time. Likewise, stress was also found to be possibly dependent on the same variables.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-06 16:59:09","","1 - 7","","","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Time is an important variable in learning context and especially in the analysis of teaching-learning processes that take place in collaborative learning, whereas time management is crucial for effective learning. The aim of this work has been to analyze the effects of emotion management on time and self-management in e-learning and identify the competencies in time and self-management that are mostly influenced when students strive to achieve effective learning. To this end, we run an experiment with a class of high school students, which showed that increasing their ability to manage emotions better and more effectively enhances their competency to manage the time allocated to the learning practice more productively, and consequently their learning performance in terms of behavioral engagement and achievement and partly, in terms of cognitive engagement and self-regulation. Teacher affective feedback was proved to be a crucial factor to enhance cognitive engagement.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:30","2018-02-06 16:57:30","","517 - 529","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Achievement orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with a distance methodology, these observations are not possible. When forums are created they are intended to discuss particular topics. It is relevant to monitor that the topics discussed are the intended ones in order to achieve course objectives. To tackle this shortcoming, our work studies the dynamics of relevant topics in on-line asynchronous discussion forums, and this is done by analyzing the large amount of students’ interactions generated in the forums of our Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we analyze the students’ behavior patterns in the forums of a distance subject, and characterize the relevant topics and subtopics from the forums’ messages belonging to two academic years.

However, the potential for the malicious use of data disclosed online necessitates attention. Risky information security behavior often leads to damage. Previous research has focused on information security behavior in the workplace; however, there has been little research on teachers' perceptions of their own information security behavior, in particular for teachers in primary and secondary education. For students at this age, their teachers can serve as models. Through understanding teachers' information security behavioral intentions and related protection motivation, we can design training programs for teachers and hence increase teachers' as well as students' normative judgment with regard to information security behavior. The purpose of this research is to explore those factors that relate to teachers' information security behavior as grounded in Protection Motivation Theory. Additionally, the construct of social norms was incorporated based on several studies. Overall, we wish to examine how perceived severity, vulnerability, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, response costs and social norms related to teachers' problematic information security behavior. Structural equation modeling was implemented to analyze the relationships. The results and implications are presented.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","334 - 345","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Information Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, ensuring that learning has taken place is the ultimate challenge. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been incorporated into game-based learning environments to guide learners’ exploration. Emotions have proven to be deeply intertwined with cognitive and motivational factors. {ITSs} attempt to recognise and convey emotion in order to enhance students’ learning and engagement. The {ITS} student model is responsible for attainment of adaptability and understanding of learners’ needs. It is not clear which emotions are relevant to the teaching-learning experience, or what antecedents and interpersonal differences are involved in determining an emotion. Therefore, student modelling involves uncertainty. Creating an emotional student model that can reason about students’ observable behaviour during online game-play is the main goal of our research. The analysis, design and implementation for this model are our central focus here. The model uses as a basis the Control-Value theory of achievement emotions and employs motivational and cognitive variables to determine an emotion. A Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM) approach was applied to facilitate the derivation of three Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) corresponding to three types of achievement emotions. Results from a prototyping exercise conducted along with the outcome-prospective emotions {DBN} are presented and discussed. In future work a larger population of students will be employed to develop an accurate {DBN} model to incorporate into PlayPhysics, an emotional game-based learning environment for teaching Physics.","2011","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-06 16:58:11","","133 - 141","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we develop a framework for connection degree calculation and measurement in high-speed networks. The bi-directional traffic flow model is employed to aggregate traffic packets, which can reduce the number of flow records and capture user's alternation behavior characteristics. The first order connection degree and joint correlation degree are selected as the features to capture the characteristics of traffic profiles. To perform careful traffic inspection and attack detection, not only the abnormal changes of a single traffic feature but also the correlations between the features are analyzed in the new framework. First, the symmetry of in and out connection degrees is analyzed. And we found that incomplete flows are an important information source for abnormal behavior detection. Second, joint correlation degree can characterize the user's communication profiles and their behavior dynamics, which are employed to perform abnormal detection using measurements based on Renyi cross entropy. Finally, the reversible degree sketch is employed for querying abnormal traffic pattern sources for real-time traffic management. The experimental results based on actual traffic traces collected from Northwest Regional Center of {CERNET} (China Education and Research Network) show the efficiency of the proposed method. The method based on Renyi entropy can detect abnormal changing points correctly. {FNR} of the reversible sketch for locating abnormal sources is below 4% and time complexity is constant and less than 4 s, which is critical for real-time traffic monitoring.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-06 16:57:18","","15 - 26","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reversible degree sketch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and {MOOCs} may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","471 - 481","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MOOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The parameter Δ in the FT-NLMS algorithm controls convergence speed and bias from the optimum tap-length, which necessitates a compromise between them due to its fixed value. Therefore, a well adjusted time-varying Δ ( n ) can provide both fast convergence speed and small steady state bias. In this paper, a new robust variable Δ ( n ) FT-NLMS is proposed that ensures a large value of Δ ( n ) when the algorithm is far from the optimum with Δ ( n ) decreasing as the adaptive filter approaches the optimum even in the presence of uncorrelated noise disturbance. Transient and steady state performance analysis of the proposed algorithm will be presented, where expressions for the algorithm steady state excess Mean-Square Error (MSE), steady state tap-length of the adaptive filter, and steady state E { Δ ( ∞ ) } are derived. Simulation examples are presented in different experimental conditions, which will demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing variable tap-length NLMS algorithms. Moreover, simulation results will show that the derived theoretical expressions can predict very well the actual behavior of the proposed algorithm.","2014-11","2018-02-21 12:52:38","2018-02-21 12:52:38","","82-91","","","34","","Digital Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filtering; NLMS algorithm; Performance analysis; Variable length filter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, there is a scarcity of research reporting on qualitative data regarding the subjective user experience of young people using social networking-based interventions for depression. This study provides in-depth qualitative insights generated from 38 semi-structured interviews, and a follow-up focus group, with young people (15–25 years) after the implementation of a moderated online social therapy intervention for depression relapse prevention (“Rebound”). Exploratory analysis identified patterns of content from interview data related to three main themes: 1) preferred content compared to perceived helpfulness of the online platform, 2) interest in social networking, and 3) protective environment. Two clear groups emerged; those who perceived the social networking component of the intervention as the most helpful component; and those who preferred to engage in therapy content, receiving individualized content suggested by moderators. The Rebound intervention was shown to be acceptable for young people with major depression. Integration of social networking features appears to enhance intervention engagement for some young people recovering from depression.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:57","2018-02-06 16:56:57","","65 - 73","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Young people","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many theories have been put forward to explain the formation, characteristics, and durability of social networks, but few address the issue of opinion leader identification. This paper proposes an improved mix framework for opinion leader identification in online learning communities. The framework is validated by an experimental study. By analysing textual content, user behaviour and time, this study ranked opinion leaders based on four distinguishing features: expertise, novelty, influence, and activity. Furthermore, the performances of opinion leaders were further investigated in terms of longevity and centrality. Experimental study on real datasets has shown that our framework effectively identifies opinion leaders in online learning communities.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-06 16:57:08","","43 - 51","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","social network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings indicate that design students' preferred learning styles are as follows, in descending order: Sensing/Intuitive, Visual/Verbal, Active/Reflective and Sequential/Global. In the two-way analysis, where the student's design studio grade was the dependent variable, significant effects were obtained for each scale.

In this study, we use two processes (pre process and post process) to select suitable rules and to explore the relationship among attributes. In pre process, we propose a pruning process to select suitable rules by setting up a threshold on the support object of decision rules, to thereby solve the problem of too many rules. The post process used the formal concept analysis from these suitable rules to explore the attribute relationship and the most important factors affecting decision making for choosing behaviours of personal investment portfolios. In this study, we explored the main concepts (characteristics) for the conservative portfolio: the stable job, less than 4 working years, and the gender is male; the moderate portfolio: high school education, the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), the gender is male; and the aggressive portfolio: the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), less than 4 working years, and a stable job.

Forty technology-experienced science teachers participated in the study. Their beliefs about and use of {TBAs} were examined using semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed based on a coding scheme adapted from the decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) model (Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995). The analysis showed that ten components were substantial in the behavioral, control, and normative beliefs. While 85% teachers (34 out of 40) perceived {TBAs} as useful tools and identified a variety of usefulness, nearly 40% of the participants indicated the difficulties in using {TBAs} and their beliefs of ease of use were mainly negative. Also, teachers’ control beliefs about {TBA} focused on the social and external components such as time, supporting personnel, and infrastructure rather than the personal factors. In their normative beliefs, teachers tended to view school policies and parents’ opinions as constraints, whereas they also realized the benefits of using {TBAs} for learning. Furthermore, three groups of teachers were identified and characterized based on their usage of TBAs. Although some frequent users did not teach in resource-rich schools and faced constraints similar to those encountered by the occasional users, they seemed to actively look for more supports and solutions to overcome the lack of resources and the disapproval from the school administration. The findings extend the {DTPB} model of technology users by adding important beliefs about teaching and learning.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","198 - 210","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The decomposed theory of planned behavior model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NCLMF algorithm is obtained by constraining the cost function of the standard LMF algorithm to the fourth-order moment of the additive noise. The NCLMF algorithm can be seen as a variable step-size LMF algorithm. The main aim of this work is to derive the NCLMF adaptive algorithm, analyze its convergence behavior, and assess its performance in different noise environments. Furthermore, the analysis of the proposed NCLMF algorithm is carried out using the concept of energy conservation. Finally, a number of simulation results are carried out to corroborate the theoretical findings, and as expected, improved performance is obtained through the use of this technique over the traditional LMF algorithm.","2011-01","2018-02-21 12:52:36","2018-02-21 12:52:36","","136-149","","1","91","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filters; Constrained optimization; LMF; LMS; NCLMF algorithm; Noise constraints","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike previous studies, in the present study, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and back-propagation (BP) algorithms were coupled to develop a robust hybrid training algorithm with both local and global search capabilities. To demonstrate the capacity of the proposed model, we applied the model to the predictions of the load–deformation behaviour of axially loaded piles. This is a soil–structure interaction problem, involving a complex mechanism of load transfer from the pile to the supporting geologic medium. A database of full scale pile loading tests is used to train and validate the product-unit network. The results show that the proposed hybrid learning algorithm simulates the load–deformation curve of axially loaded piles more accurately than other BP, PSO, and existing PSO–BP hybrid methods. The network developed using the proposed algorithm also turns out to be more accurate than hyperbolic and t − z models.","2013-11","2018-02-21 12:52:47","2018-02-21 12:52:47","","2305-2314","","10","26","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hybrid training; Neural network; Piled foundation; Product-unit neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This pilot study examined the feasibility of delivering a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) gaming intervention (SPARX-R) for young people (age 15–20 years) who have left school early and are attending Youthreach, an alternative education (AE) program in Ireland. Method Students (n = 146) from twenty-one Youthreach Centers were randomized to SPARX-R and no-intervention control. All students within the group were included in the study whether or not they were exhibiting heightened levels of depression. Program impact was examined on both negative and positive indicators of mental health, including depression (primary outcome), generalized anxiety, general mental wellbeing, coping and emotion regulation. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-intervention (7 weeks). Participants that provided data at post-assessment (n = 66) were included in the analysis. Results The participants completed on average 5.3 modules of SPARX-R with 30% (n = 9) completing the entire program. A significant improvement in emotion regulation strategies was detected, with expressive suppression decreasing significantly in the SPARX-R group in comparison to the control (− 2.97, 95% {CI} − 5.48 to − 0.46, p = 0.03). Conclusions Findings suggest that SPARX-R has a positive impact on emotion regulation. The lack of significant findings on other outcome measures may be attributed to inadequate sample size, and therefore, further research with larger samples are required to establish the effectiveness of the program in reducing depression and anxiety and improving psychological wellbeing among young people attending AE.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","40 - 47","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Disadvantaged youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirteen participants with at least mild symptoms of depression on the (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item; PHQ-9; total scores ≥ 5) or anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GAD-7; total scores ≥ 5) accessed the online Arabic Wellbeing Course, which consisted of five online lessons delivered over eight weeks with weekly clinician support. Measures of depression, anxiety, distress and disability were administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Data were analysed using generalised estimation equation (GEE) modelling. Seventy-seven percent (10/13) of participants completed the five lessons over eight weeks, with 10/13 providing post-treatment and 3-month follow-up data. Participants improved significantly across all outcome measures, with large within-group effect sizes based on estimated marginal means (Cohen's d) at post-treatment (d = 1.18 to 1.62) and 3-month follow-up (d = 1.28 to 1.72). In addition, 40% and 38% of participants obtained, at least, a 50% improvement in symptoms of both anxiety and depression at 3-month follow-up respectively. Participants rated the Arabic Wellbeing Course as acceptable, and 70% of those who completed follow-up questionnaires reported accessing the course in both English and Arabic languages. Notwithstanding the limitations of an open trial design, these results are encouraging and indicate that culturally modified clinician-guided internet-delivered versions of Western psychological interventions have the potential for increasing access to treatment for Arabic-speaking Australians, and potentially other groups.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","5 - 11","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Transdiagnostic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dashboards are often composed of different data visualization techniques, amongst which are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which play a crucial role in quickly providing accurate information by comparing current performance against a target required to fulfil business objectives. However, {KPIs} are not always well known and sometimes it is difficult to find an appropriate {KPI} to associate with each business objective. In addition, Data Mining techniques are often used when forecasting trends and visualizing data correlations. In this paper we present a new approach to combining these two aspects in order to drive Data Mining techniques to obtain specific {KPIs} for business objectives in a semi-automated way. The main benefit of our approach is that organizations do not need to rely on existing {KPI} lists or test {KPIs} over a cycle as they can analyze their behavior using existing data. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we apply our proposal to the fields of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Data extracted from the University of Alicante in order to identify the KPIs.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 17:58:22","","76 - 85","","","54, Part 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","open data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the {LBPN} extends the colored tokens of colored Petri nets to identify learners and learning contents, and raises the time variable to represent diverse learning times for individual learners. To verify the viability of the LBPN, this paper also proposes a LBPN-based learning behavioral model to simulate a situation in which many learners participate in an e-learning course, and then to generate their behavioral patterns. The experimental results illustrated in this paper confirm that (1) the generated behavioral pattern based on the LBPN-based model is very close to actual data, (2) the time and cost spent to verify the effectiveness of an {ITS} is substantially reduced, (3) adequate testing data for estimating the performance and accuracy of an {ITS} is easily acquired, and (4) the LBPN-based model can be built to recommend appropriate learning contents and to accomplish adaptive learning.","2010","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","995 - 1009","","6","180","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Web-based learning environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings also show that data visualization is a useful tool for social learning analytics, and how it may provide additional information about actors and their behaviors for decision making in online distance learning.","2015","2018-02-06 16:56:36","2018-02-21 13:53:45","","68 - 80","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization; Learning analytics; Online distance learning; Social learning analytics; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simulation system provides a mechanism for evaluating the performance of data-driven models of disease progression, which bring together biomarker measurements from large cross-sectional (or short term longitudinal) cohorts to recover the average population-wide dynamics. We demonstrate the use of the simulation framework in two different ways. First, to evaluate the performance of the Event Based Model (EBM) for recovering biomarker abnormality orderings from cross-sectional datasets. Second, to evaluate the performance of a differential equation model (DEM) for recovering biomarker abnormality trajectories from short-term longitudinal datasets. Results highlight several important considerations when applying data-driven models to sporadic disease datasets as well as key areas for future work. The system reveals several important insights into the behaviour of each model. For example, the {EBM} is robust to noise on the underlying biomarker trajectory parameters, under-sampling of the underlying disease time course and outliers who follow alternative event sequences. However, the {EBM} is sensitive to accurate estimation of the distribution of normal and abnormal biomarker measurements. In contrast, we find that the {DEM} is sensitive to noise on the biomarker trajectory parameters, resulting in an over estimation of the time taken for biomarker trajectories to go from normal to abnormal. This over estimate is approximately twice as long as the actual transition time of the trajectory for the expected noise level in neurodegenerative disease datasets. This simulation framework is equally applicable to a range of other models and longitudinal analysis techniques.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","47 - 56","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Simulation system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the research conducted on this topic focuses on the application of interaction models to analyze the content of asynchronous discussions and assess their quality. Despite the existence of different models, the one developed by Gunawardena, Lowe, and Anderson (1997) remains as one of the most used in the study of online interaction. In this respect, the present work focuses on studies that mention the application of this model in its analysis and discusses the extension of its application as well as its limitations. Results reinforce the adequacy of the model to analyze knowledge construction in different types of communication tools, but they also suggest the need to look at how learning is orchestrated and the importance of re-defining some aspects of the model in question.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","574 - 582","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","content analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However there is a certain degree of difficulty in understanding a system represented by means of {UML} diagrams. Object Our previous research demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding the structural aspects of a system represented as a {UML} class diagram when using a feedback-inclusive prototype of a model. This paper extends our previous work with an empirical validation study for the effectiveness of the feedback-inclusive rapid prototyping (FIRP) method, on the comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting {UML} statecharts. Because models often combine structural and behavioural views that are highly intertwined, we additionally evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to comprehension of the between-view consistency. Method The {FIRP} environment was built following the principles of Design Science Research in Information Systems. This study targets the empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed technique using an experimental study method. Two experiments were conducted with the participation of 65 final-year master students in the context of different modelling courses from different study programs at {KU} Leuven using two two-group factorial experimental designs. The effectiveness of the {FIRP} method was measured by comparing students’ performance between the cycles with and without the use of the method, using the understandability (comprehension test results) as the dependent variable and the use of {FIRP} as the independent variable. Effects from unknown variables were neutralized by means of randomized group compositions. The effectiveness of {FIRP} was additionally assessed with respect to personal characteristics (age, gender, previous knowledge, self-efficacy) and user acceptance (perceived ease of use, perceived utility, preference, satisfaction). Results The findings reveal a significant positive impact of the use of the prototyping technique on students’ comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting statecharts. Conclusions The findings provide empirical support for the advantage of the use of {FIRP} over manual inspection of interacting statecharts. The findings also suggest that the method is suitable for training system's analysis and modelling skills when {UML} statecharts are involved.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","159 - 172","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Testability of requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims at analysing and quantifying the impact of such situations, particularly cut-fill transitions combined with the presence of culverts, on the train-track system response. A cut-fill transition on a buried culvert is used as case study for which track geometry and stiffness evaluation data were available. A numerical model, considering the coupled train-track interaction, was developed using a 3D {FEM} dynamic analysis tool that was further improved here with a mixed implicit-explicit time integration scheme. The results suggest that the faster degradation rates typically found at similar locations are mostly related to the development of early permanent deformations in the subgrade layers, rather than to sudden stiffness transitions, which then aggravate the problem by causing important dynamic amplifications in the train-track interaction. Therefore, numerical approaches similar to the one presented herein can be valuable tools for designers and railway infrastructure managers in order to anticipate and mitigate such negative effects at these locations.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-06 16:58:06","","49 - 61","","","189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Three-dimensional numerical modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a first view, we confirmed the paucity of research related to this theme, even with the large increase of social media studies. As findings, we identified some important research trends towards public organizations using the content created by citizens to improve public services, as well as companies using social media tools to improve innovation processes.

While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","31 - 48","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Systematic literature review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. are becoming increasingly important social media, but people aged 50 years and over use these resources at lower rates than those in younger age groups. In this paper we aim to investigate the factors affecting the use of online social networks by active older Internet users in Slovenia. Additionally, we address how often, and to what extent, active older Internet users are engaged in using ICT. A research study is presented that was conducted among active older Internet users, on the basis of a non-standardised research questionnaire. Collected data were analysed with basic descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistical methods, followed by induction of a decision tree using the {WEKA} (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) 3.7 programming environment. Research findings revealed that female participants are more familiar with the term 'online social network' and are also more frequent users, compared to male participants. Additionally, the results showed that age, gender and education seem to be the most important factors having a direct or indirect impact on the use of online social networks by active older Internet users.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-06 16:57:18","","230 - 241","","","55, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the basic question whether {UX} constructs are measurable, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 {UX} researchers from academia and one {UX} practitioner from the industry where a set of questions in relation to {UX} measurement were explored (Study 1). The interviewees expressed scepticism as well as ambivalence towards {UX} measures and shared anecdotes related to such measures in different contexts. Interestingly, the results suggested that design-oriented {UX} professionals tended to be sceptical about {UX} measurement. To examine whether such an attitude prevailed in the {HCI} community, we conducted a survey – {UX} Measurement Attitudes Survey (UXMAS) – with essentially the same set of 13 questions used in the interviews (Study 2). Specifically, participants were asked to rate a set of five statements to assess their attitude towards {UX} measurement, to identify (non)measurable experiential qualities with justifications, and to discuss the topic from the theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives. The survey was implemented in a paper-based and an online format. Altogether, 367 responses were received; 170 of them were valid and analysed. The survey provided empirical evidence on this issue as a baseline for progress in {UX} measurement. Overall, the survey results indicated that the attitude towards {UX} measurement was more positive than that identified in the interviews, and there were nuanced views on details of {UX} measurement. Implications for enhancing the acceptance of {UX} measures and the interplay between {UX} evaluation and system development are drawn: {UX} modelling grounded in theories to link experiential qualities with outcomes; the development of {UX} measurement tools with good measurement properties, and education within the {HCI} community to disseminate validated models, and measurement tools as well as their successful applications. Mutual recognition of the value of objective measures and subjective accounts of user experience can enhance the maturity of this area.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","526 - 541","","6","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Experiential quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research examines the public perception of futuristic auction-based tolling systems, with a focus on the public acceptance of such systems over current tolling practices on highways (e.g., dynamic and fixed tolling methodologies). Through a stated-preference survey, responses from 159 road-users residing in Virginia are elicited to understand route choice behavior under a descending price auction implemented on a hypothetical two-route network. Analysis of the survey data shows that there is no outright rejection of the presented auction-based tolling among those who are familiar with the current tolling methods. While males strongly support the new method, no clear pattern emerges among other demographic variables such as income and education level, and age. While high income respondents and regular commuters are more likely to pay higher tolls, no statistical significance between different genders, age groups, household sizes, and education levels is found. Based on the modeling results and the hypothetical road network, it is found that descending price tolling method yields higher average toll rates, and generates at least 70% more revenue when travel time saving is 30 min, and improves capacity utilization of the toll road significantly compared to fixed tolls.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","268 - 285","","","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Choice models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Australian {NBN} is the largest infrastructure project in Australia's history since the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 to 1972 and it has a projected cost of between AU$37 billion and AU$43 billion. Its purposes are to provide high speed broadband connectivity to 93% of Australia's homes and businesses, to enhance productivity, to improve the delivery of education, tele-medicine and regional connectivity and to form the basis of the Australian telecommunications network for the 21st Century. However, the project does not have bi-partisan support and has been affected by high-level management changes and anticipated cost over-runs. The legal implications of the Australian {NBN} are as vast as the project itself. Its implementation has involved the enactment of a suite of Commonwealth legislation and will involve considerable competition law and long-term access issues which have already been much critiqued. However, despite information technology being in the top five critical infrastructures internationally, a critical infrastructure analysis of the {NBN} has had little public attention. Similarly, due to the confidential nature of much of the NBN's operations, the cybersecurity aspects of the project have only been lightly scrutinised. Paradoxically, it is contended that greater scrutiny and public access to vital information will provide enhanced, not less, security for both the network itself and for Australian users and will also provide for a more secure and reliable engagement with Australia's international trading partners. Given the need for a high level of trust in, and the immense reliance upon, the Australian NBN, consumer and business confidence can only be enhanced by greater awareness of the critical infrastructure implications of the Australian {NBN} for Australia's future.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","699 - 709","","6","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Broadband Network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed method integrates the data with a pivot table by preprocessing Moodle course logs and generates a time series cross section (TSCS) table that visualizes the student’s course material page views. Experiments conducted on Moodle page views of actual materials collected during actual lessons found that the table visualizes both overall and individual viewpoints. Reactions to teacher instructions on course materials during class can also be visualized by the generated {TSCS} table. Moreover, because students who open course items late or do not open them can be identified clearly, the method can be used as a reference for improving future classes.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:03","2018-02-06 16:57:03","","1835 - 1844","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","data integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The external demands tend to be unpredictable and exhibit a high degree of burstability. To sustain a good viewing experience for the users, an important QoS support for this class of applications is the peak load management in the presence of unpredictable demand. This relies on a close grasp of the demand behavior characteristics and an accurate prediction model for them. In this paper, we analyze live sports event broadcast service workloads from a commercial Internet service provider. Our results show that popularity follows a 2-mode Zipf distribution. We also observe some significant characteristics of the demand behavior. First, the demand behavior may differ significantly between games. Popular events tend to exhibit highly variable behaviors in time, volume and the change rate during the course. Finally, the demand variation highly correlates with certain event-specific time points. We conclude the paper with a preliminary study that applies three simple statistical models in workload prediction at runtime as an input to dynamic resource resizing in a cloud. The results indicate that more e ective ways are needed to better capture the dynamics and unpredictability of the workload to improve prediction accuracy.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:52","2018-02-06 16:57:52","","1028 - 1033","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","dynamic resource allocation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to identify the influential factors that have an impact on individuals' ethical decision-making and propose a model of the factors that are significant in the ethical decision-making process in the {SNS} context. This study employed the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and included personal normative beliefs, moral intensity, perceived threat of legal punishment to the main constructs of {TPB} namely attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control to predict the behavioral intention using a scenario based questionnaire. The moderating effects of several factors, including age, gender, level of income, ego strength, locus of control and religion, were investigated for the probable effect on the proposed model. Derived from a designed procedure, several scenarios were constructed, of which four were selected to be embedded in the survey instrument. With 441 returned questionnaires in hand, the collected data were analyzed using the partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique. The results showed attitude to be the most influential factor, followed by subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, personal normative beliefs, and moral intensity. Level of education, age, and scenario also showed a significant effect on the relation between predictors and behavioral intention.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:42","2018-02-06 16:57:42","","545 - 561","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acceptance studies focus on the predictors of system adoption and use, with behavioral intention to use the system as a proxy for actual use. This study proposes a TAM3-based model – with the inclusion of two additional variables: personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology and perceived interaction – to study the factors influencing the acceptance of e-learning systems. Attention is also brought towards the role of behavioral intention, especially in its relation with use behavior. In order to do so, two different settings were considered: higher education and lifelong learning; data was gathered from a survey administrated to Spanish graduate and lifelong learning students, and partial least squares analysis was used to test the research model. Results supported {TAM} relations, except for the intention-behavior linkage, and unveiled a dual nature of perceived usefulness – with one component related to efficiency and performance, and another component related to flexibility. The adequacy of applying TAM3-based models in educational contexts and suitability of actual system usage measures are also discussed.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-21 13:14:05","","301 - 314","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioral intention; Educational technology acceptance; Self-reported use; TAM3; Use behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper is based on revealed data collected in the New York City area, that were analysed with the assistance of discrete choice models. The results provide insight into the nature of the underlying decision making process. A number of results stand out. The first one is that the time saved by using {ETC} at the toll booths does not play a statistically significant role in the decision to use ETC. This result is conceptually correct because: (1) the time saved at the toll booths when using {ETC} is a relatively small portion of the total travel time in the hyper-congested network in the New York City area and (2) the actual time saved is curtailed by upstream congestion that makes it difficult for drivers to reach the ETC-only toll booths, and by downstream congestion that frequently prevents driver from crossing the toll booths. The second set of results is related to the perceived financial benefits of using ETC. Two variables were found to play a significant role in increasing {ETC} use: the toll savings (the difference between cash and {ETC} tolls), and drivers’ awareness of the toll discounts offered. Other socio-economic attributes have a direct relationship with the likelihood of using ETC: the number of trips made through the facilities, auto ownership, college education, age, and income. The results also indicate significant differences by ethnicity as racial minorities (i.e., African–Americans and Hispanics) are less inclined to use {ETC} than Caucasians. From the policy standpoint, these results imply that in order to increase {ETC} use, the difference between cash and {ETC} tolls should be increased, and accompanied with outreach campaigns to raise awareness of the toll discounts available to {ETC} users. The underrepresentation of ethnic minorities should also be addressed by implementing specially designed outreach efforts to gain insight into the factors that shape their attitude toward ETC. Taken together, the results in the paper—and in a companion paper that focuses on freight users—provide clear suggestions that could be used to increase {ETC} use, and enable the transportation system to fully exploit the potential benefits of such an important technology.","2011","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","498 - 509","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Passenger car user behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose we consider 1-Nearest-Neighbor classifiers, a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier and pattern mining techniques based on the criteria support and lift. For evaluation we focus on the case of a curious {DNS} resolver. Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of the techniques using a common, large-scale dataset that contains the {DNS} queries issued by more than 3600 users over the course of two months. We find that behavior-based tracking is feasible: The best technique can link up to 85.4% of the surfing sessions of all users on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, for tracking to be effective only the most significant features or the most popular hostnames have to be considered. Our results indicate that users can degrade accuracy by changing their {IP} addresses more frequently, e.g., every few minutes. On the other hand, we find that the previously proposed {DNS} “range query” obfuscation techniques cannot prevent tracking reliably. Our findings are not limited to {DNS} traffic. Behavior-based tracking can be implemented by any adversary that has access to the web requests issued by users or their machines.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:01","2018-02-06 16:59:01","","17 - 33","","","39, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pseudonymization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the label, such robots are typically only social within scripted activities. The current study takes a critical look at the case of a robotic tutor which was implemented in an elementary school for 3.5 months, where children repeatedly took turns interacting with the robot individually as well as in pairs. The aim of the study was to explore what caused breakdowns in children's interactions with the robotic tutor. In this qualitative study, over 14 h of video recordings of children's interaction sessions were analyzed in-depth through interaction analysis and thematic analysis. The results comprise four themes to explain why children's interactions with the robotic tutor break down: (1) the robot's inability to evoke initial engagement and identify misunderstandings, (2) confusing scaffolding, (3) lack of consistency and fairness, and finally, (4) controller problems. The implications of these breakdowns for the educational use of robots are discussed, and it is concluded that several challenges need to be rigorously addressed in order for robotic tutors to be able to feature in education.","2018","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","250 - 264","","","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Thematic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data from their participation were recorded, quantified and compared with their resulting grades on exams to ascertain to what degree measures of student participation were related to student learning. These measures of student participation were augmented by data from the university's student information system, which provided background information. Data was also collected from a number of surveys administered over the semester. Analyses of the data revealed some strong relationships between grades and the degree and quality of student participation. Moreover the behavior of students varied significantly when stratified by their incoming GPA. The empirical relationships reported here provide evidence-based affirmation that student participation is related to learning and suggests that the strength of GPA as a predictor of grades may be due more to a lack the study skills and/or motivation rather than cognitive ability.","2015-10-21","2018-02-21 12:20:30","2018-02-21 12:20:30","","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Atmospheric measurements; cognition; cognitive ability; computer aided instruction; data analysis; Data collection; educational administrative data processing; educational courses; educational institutions; evidence-based affirmation; face-to-face course; GPA; Internet; introductory science course; learning analytics; LectureTools; Meteorology; online course; Particle measurements; Sea measurements; student engagement; student learning; student outcomes; student participation; Synchronization; University of Michigan; university student information system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a Pedagogical Framework to Measure Pedagogical Activity","2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","2161-3761","","10.1109/ICALT.2015.62","","The proliferation of Web-based learning objects makes finding and evaluating online resources problematic. While established Learning Analytics methods use Web interaction to evaluate learner engagement, there is uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of these measures. In this paper we propose a method for evaluating pedagogical activity in Web-based comments using a pedagogical framework, and present a preliminary study that assigns a Pedagogical Value (PV) to comments. This has value as it categorises discussion in terms of pedagogical activity rather than Web interaction. Results show that PV is distinct from typical interactional measures, there are negative or insignificant correlations with established Learning Analytics methods, but strong correlations with relevant linguistic indicators of learning, suggesting that the use of pedagogical frameworks may produce more accurate indicators than interaction analysis, and that linguistic rather than interaction analysis has the potential to automatically identify learning behaviour.","2015-07-06","2018-02-21 12:20:29","2018-02-21 12:20:29","","265-267","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collaboration; Computational modeling; computer aided instruction; Conferences; Correlation; Density measurement; discussion forums; Encoding; interaction analysis; Internet; language analysis; learner engagement; learning analytics; learning analytics methods; learning behaviour; MOOC; online resources; pedagogical activity; pedagogical framework; pedagogical frameworks; pedagogical value; Pragmatics; PV; web-based learning; Web based learning objects; Web interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis to identify themes from the transcripts. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results We interviewed 32 patients; 37.5% male. Our analysis revealed three primary themes: (1) the views and beliefs of patients on the use of {EHR} in clinics, (2) patients’ perception of the communication skills of residents, and (3) patients’ perceptions about information sharing, patient engagement, and health education related to the EHR. An invitation to patients to view the screen as the physician interprets its content increases patient satisfaction and understanding.

This study compares the long-term career and practice choices of participants in a 2-month Indiana University-Moi University, Kenya elective from 1989–2013 with those of a control group. Methods Global health elective (GHE) participants and a random sample of alumni without {GHE} experience were surveyed on their clinical practice, public health and global health activities. Results Responses from 176 former participants were compared with a control group of 177 alumni. {GHE} participants were more likely than similar controls to provide care to underserved U.S. populations (p=0.037), spend time in global health, public health, and public policy activities (p=0.005) and be involved in global health advocacy (p=0.001). Using multivariable analysis, {GHE} participants were more likely to be generalists (p&lt;0.05), report that healthcare costs influenced medical decision-making (p&lt;0.05), and provide healthcare outside the U.S. for ≥1 week/year (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Many years out of training, {GHE} participants were more likely to be generalists working with underserved populations, to be cost-conscious in their healthcare decision-making, and to be involved in global health, public health or public policy. Implications With the primary care provider shortage and need for greater awareness among providers of healthcare costs, our study shows that that global health experiences may yield broader benefits to the U.S. medical system.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","185 - 189","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Medical practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, the analysis and the response provided by the automatic system are also envisioned to be continuous over the course of time, within the boundaries of digital machine output. The term continuous affect analysis is used as analysis that is continuous in time as well as analysis that uses affect phenomenon represented in dimensional space. The former refers to acquiring and processing long unsegmented recordings for detection of an affective state or event (e.g., nod, laughter, pain), and the latter refers to prediction of an affect dimension (e.g., valence, arousal, power).

As a result, huge quantities of data about students’ learning process have been recorded and stored. Teachers can apply data-mining techniques to mine students’ learning performance. One such technique is association rule mining, which can find correlations between student characteristics and performance. For instance, a rule (Attendance = Middle) ∧ (Gender = Male) → (Semester = Low) indicates that the semester grade of students is at the Low level if their gender is Male and attendance rate is Middle, where Low and Middle are predetermined linguistic terms given by teachers. Teachers can rely on such rules to formulate their teaching strategies. However, these rules may be varied in different semesters because of the change of student characteristics or teaching method of teachers. The above rule is used to describe student behavior during the last semester, yet, within this semester, the rule changes to (Attendance = Low) ∧ (Gender = Female) → (Semester = Low). Without updating this knowledge, teachers might adopt inappropriate teaching strategies for students who are learning in different ways across different semesters. In this study, we propose a new change mining model to discover the change in student learning performance and characteristics on the basis of association rules. We conducted experiments with real-life datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-21 13:14:36","","773 - 792","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association rule; Change mining; Educational data mining; Learning performance; Teaching strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thrust of research and implementation in this field is mainly powered by the use of the well-known mean-square cost function upon which relies the ubiquitous least-mean square (LMS) algorithm. However, such an algorithm is well-known to lead to sub-optimal solutions in the real world that is largely dominated by non-Gaussian interference signals. The use of a non-mean-square cost function would successfully tackle these types of interference signals but would invariably involve a higher computational cost. To address these important practical issues, this paper proposes a new adaptive equalization technique that combines both the least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm, which is governed by a non-mean-square cost function, with a power-of-two quantizer (PTQ) in the coefficient update process, which greatly reduces the computational cost involved and which therefore makes the proposed technique applicable to time-varying environments. This paper not only elaborates on the basic idea behind the proposed technique but also defines the necessary assumptions and provides a thorough statistical performance analysis (including a study of the convergence behavior) of the combined algorithm LMF-PTQ that is at the core of the proposed technique. An extensive simulation work was carried out and showed that the theoretical predictions are very well substantiated.","2011-05","2018-02-21 12:52:47","2018-02-21 12:52:47","","447-465","","3","21","","Digital Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive equalization; LMF algorithm; Power-of-two quantizer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study the effect of human factors in driving, a simulator with Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Driver-in-the-Loop (DIL), and an instrumented vehicle were developed to quantitatively measure the driver actions, vehicle status, and the relationship with the vehicle. A comparative analysis of the differences was carried out in a driving simulator and also in the real-world environment. After 33 various driver experiments were conducted, a set of special data-processing programs were also developed to review, extract, and analyze the captured data. Some representative parameters such as time to collision (TTC) and time headway (THW) are adopted to analyze and compare the effect of human factors, which include age, gender, driving experience, workload, education level, and nationality. Finally, to ensure the consistency of classifications based on subjective evaluation and objective experimental data, tests including the completion of a driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ) and real-world driving were conducted with 52 participants and compared. Factor analysis theory was applied to the data processing and characteristic extractions. The results of the study indicated that there were significant differences between the subjective evaluation and objective data, i.e. the subjective evaluation was not reliable enough for algorithm design, although it can be used as a reference.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","111 - 157","","","","","","","","","","","Academic Press","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-397199-9.00005-7","","","","time headway (THW)","","Chen, Yaobin; Li, Lingxi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this perspective, it is recognized that police officers play a significant role in adapting and responding to unexpected or unknown situations, as well as recognized situations, such as theft or domestic dispute. Accordingly, “sensemaking” (Weick, 1995; Dervin, 1983, 1992, 1996) and situational awareness are viewed as working concepts that enable us to investigate and improve the interaction between police and information technology. Information is used strategically in three areas: to make sense of change in its environment, to create new knowledge for innovation, and to make decisions about courses of action. These seemingly distinct processes are in fact complementary pieces of a larger puzzle, and the information behaviors analyzed in each approach interweave into a richer explanation of information use in law enforcement agencies. Through “sensemaking,” people in an organization give meaning to the events and actions of the organization. Through knowledge creation, the insights of individuals are converted into knowledge that can be used to design new products or improve performance. Finally, in decision making, understanding and knowledge are focused on the selection of and commitment to an appropriate course of action.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","85 - 99","","","","","","","","","","","Syngress","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-804629-6.00005-5","","","","CRN","","Au, Man Ho; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This provides potentially valuable insights into the deeper user experience that is often very easy to miss in the course of a usability test. These tools are becoming much easier to use, more accurate, more versatile and powerful, and even quite affordable. A structured approach to collecting unprompted verbal expressions during a usability test can be very helpful. Eye tracking can be a significant benefit in many kinds of usability tests. The technology continues to improve, becoming more accurate, easier to use, and less intrusive. The value is being able to compare the effectiveness of different designs, as well as calculate metrics based on areas of interest. There are three ways to measure emotions: skin conductance, facial expressions, and electroencephalography (EEG). Skin conductance measures level of arousal, facial expressions are classified and associated with six basic emotions, and {EEG} measures brain wave activity with unique signatures tied to specific emotional responses. There are new technologies based on each approach, and even integrate eye movement data into their applications. These are powerful new tools to gain insight into the emotional response of the user. Stress is an important component of the user experience. It is measured most often as heart rate variance. Other techniques for capturing information about the participant’s behavior, such as a mouse that registers how tightly it is being gripped, are on the horizon and may become useful additions to the battery of tools available for use in usability testing.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-06 16:57:18","","163 - 186","","","","","","","Interactive Technologies","","","","Morgan Kaufmann","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-415781-1.00007-8","","","","heart rate variance","","Tullis, Tom; Albert, Bill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Second Edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Checking in online and at kiosks in the airport is gaining ground on the use of the airline check-in desk. The objective of this paper is to analyse the socio-demographic factors or flight characteristics that influence a passenger’s choice of check-in from the various options available. For this a multinomial logit is used and applied to an extensive sample of almost 20,000 passengers, of whom 43% were foreigners, at five Spanish airports. The factors that determine the choice of check-in mode include the passenger’s age and level of education, the reason for making the journey, waiting time and the type of airline. The universal use of the new technologies in airport management, and the broad cosmopolitan sample mean that the conclusions can be easily extrapolated to other airport systems.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:23","2018-02-06 16:57:23","","2431 - 2437","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multinomial logit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An alternative illfare framework has been developed to take into account the disutility of unfavorable variables. The illfare level is assumed to increase with the inequality of the distribution. In some social and economic fields, such as those related to employment, health, education, or deprivation, the characteristics of the individuals in the population are represented by bounded variables, which encode either achievements or shortfalls. Accordingly, both the social welfare and the social illfare levels may be assessed depending on the framework we focus on. In this paper we propose a unified dual framework in which welfare and illfare levels can both be investigated and analyzed in a natural way. The dual framework leads to the consistent measurement of achievements and shortfalls, thereby overcoming one important difficulty of the traditional approach, in which the focus on achievements or shortfalls often leads to different inequality rankings. A number of welfare functions associated with inequality indices are {OWA} operators. Specifically this paper considers the welfare functions associated with the classical inequality measures due to Gini, Bonferroni, and De Vergottini. These three indices incorporate different value judgments in the measurement of inequality, leading to different behavior under income transfers between individuals in the population. In the bounded variables representation, we examine the dual decomposition and the orness degree of the three classical welfare/illfare functions in the standard framework of aggregation functions on the [ 0 , 1 ] n domain. The dual decomposition of each welfare/illfare function into a self-dual central index and an anti-self-dual inequality index leads to the consistent measurement of achievements and shortfalls.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-06 16:59:09","","114 - 136","","","228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Orness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study of a behavior defined by its absence (i.e., the not using of information) involved the development of a methodology consisting of an iterative performance of a nine-step heuristic leading to a retroductive recognition of absence, here termed RRA. Principal results The study concluded with a hierarchical taxonomy of the mechanisms that compel a person not to use information. The six primary mechanisms are:1. Intrinsic somatic (bodily) conditions 2. Socio-environmental barriers 3. Authoritarian controls 4. Threshold knowledge shortfall 5. Attention shortfall 6. Information filtering. Major conclusions The resultant taxonomy of {CNI} appears here as a comprehensive checklist with which information workers such as the teacher, librarian, advertiser, politician, or health care professional can respond efficiently and effectively to situations of nonuse of information. For example, a teacher might ask: “Why are students not responding to what I present?” Further, the social implications of any compelled behavior touch the very basis of the social contract, and this paper presents a first step toward understanding the compelled aspects of CNI.","2011","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","363 - 375","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Abduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two experiments were conducted in which eye-tracking, written, and verbal data were collected from 29 novices and 6 subject matter experts. The results showed that despite some similar strategies, novices and experts followed different patterns during the {CM} development process. Both experts and novices embraced deductive reasoning and preferred hierarchical type CMs. Additional points studied during the process include filling out requested information in different orders, branch construction pattern, content richness and progress pattern. Furthermore, eye behavior patterns also differed among experts and novices. Expert participants differed from novices in all eye behavior metrics (fixation count, fixation and visit duration for specific actions). Novices’ fixation count (FC) numbers were higher than the experts’ during the entire process and in specific periods. In conclusion, these pattern differences affect the {CM} development process directly. Considering the patterns revealed in the study may help instructors guide learners more adequately and effectively.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","82 - 93","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Expertise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Likewise, it requires a significant programming effort each time that the vehicle must perform a different manipulation operation. In this paper we propose, instead, to use a cognitive system that learns the intervention task from an expert operator through an intuitive learning by demonstration (LbD) algorithm. Taking as an input few operator demonstrations, the algorithm generalizes the task knowledge into a model and is able to control the vehicle and the manipulator simultaneously to reproduce the task, thus conferring a more adaptive behavior in front of the environment changes and allowing to easily transfer the knowledge of new tasks. A cognitive architecture has been implemented in order to integrate the LbD algorithm with the onboard sensors and actuators and to allow its interplay with the vehicle perception, control and navigation modules. To validate the full framework we present real experiments in a water tank using an {AUV} equipped with a four DoF manipulator. A human operator teaches the system to perform a valve turning intervention and we analyze the results of multiple task reproductions, including cases under the effect of water current perturbations, showing the success of the system in autonomously reproducing the task.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:02","2018-02-06 16:59:02","","91 - 99","","","67, Part 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","knowledge acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the self-determination theory and on the assumption that low levels of basic need satisfaction may relate to FoMO and social media engagement, the aim of the present research was to examine for the first time possible links between FoMO, social media engagement, and three motivational constructs: Intrinsic, extrinsic and amotivation for learning. Data were gathered from 296 undergraduate students by using the following scales: Social Media Engagement (SME), Fear of Missing Out (FoMOs) and Academic Motivation. The {SME} is a new scale, specifically designed for this study to measure the extent to which students used social media in the classroom. This scale includes three categories: Social engagement, news information engagement and commercial information engagement. Path analysis results indicated that the positive links between social media engagement and two motivational factors: Extrinsic and amotivation for learning are more likely to be mediated by FoMO. Interpretation of these results, their congruence within the context of the theoretical frameworks and practical implications are discussed.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-06 16:57:18","","111 - 119","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","higher education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data mining can be used to learn about student’s behavior from data collected using the course management system such as Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Developmental Learning Environment). Here in this paper we show how data mining techniques such as clustering and association rule algorithm is useful in Course Recommendation System which recommends the course to the student based on choice of other students for particular set of courses collected from Moodle. As a result of Course Recommendation System, we can recommend to new student who has recently enrolled for some course e.g. Operating System, the new course to be opted e.g. Distributed System. Our approach uses combination of clustering technique – Simple K-means and association rule algorithm – Apriori and finds the result. These results were compared with the results of open source data mining tool-Weka. The result obtained using combined approach matches with real world interdependencies among the courses. Other combinations of clustering and association rule algorithms are also discussed here to select the best combination. This Course Recommendation System could help in building intelligent recommender system. This approach of recommending courses to new students can be immensely be useful in “MOOC (Massively Open Online Courses)”.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","1 - 14","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PredictiveApriori","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without prior knowledge of clustering structure, i.e. nodes do not know which clusters they belong to beforehand, distributed algorithms for parameter estimation have received great attention in recent years. In most previous work, each node collaborates with all its neighboring nodes at each iteration, which introduces unnecessary communication assumption when any node cooperates with neighboring nodes from different clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-reducing diffusion LMS (Least-Mean-Square) algorithm, called the CR-dLMS algorithm, for estimating true parameters in multi-task environment. Under the CR-dLMS algorithm, we control the probabilities of data fusion from neighboring nodes by minimizing mean-square-deviation (MSD) to reduce communication cost among nodes. Theoretical analysis for the learning behavior of the CR-dLMS algorithm is performed, and simulation results show that the CR-dLMS algorithm can indeed achieve the same estimation performance as several other previous algorithms while great reducing the communication cost among nodes.","2017-03","2018-02-21 12:52:32","2018-02-21 12:52:32","","115-134","","","382–383","","Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Communication cost; Diffusion LMS; Distributed estimation; Mean square deviation; Multi-task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing use of personal mobile devices and the trending adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) practices, this threat has become even more versatile and dreadful as it could hide behind the users' typical and daily Internet activities. The importance of investigating whether the user's intention to perform malware avoidance behaviours would change across multiple contexts is emphasised. Consequently, this study determines the contributing factors and compares their impacts on such intention by extending Protection Motivation Theory in two different contexts. A total of 252 Australian higher education students were surveyed when using mobile devices such as smartphone, laptop and tablet at home and at a BYOD-enabled university. Paired t-test, Bayesian structural equation modelling, and revised z-test were employed for data analysis. The empirical findings reveal that intention to perform malware avoidance behaviours differed across the contexts. Furthermore, the researchers found perceptions of self-efficacy and vulnerability to have different impacts on such intention and other variables in the model. As a result, such findings suggested developing community of practice and repeated trainings to maintain the users' confidence in their own abilities to cope with malware threats. Message that focuses on the threats' consequences was suggested to improve home users' intention to avoid malware, along with a number of factors that could be critical to designing information security education programs. Moreover, these implications particularly address information security management at educational institutions that adopt {BYOD} policy. Finally, theoretical contributions include an extended model based on Protection Motivation Theory that reflects the users' intention to avoid malware threats in {BYOD} context, from which directions for future research were also provided.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-06 16:57:19","","281 - 297","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian structural equation modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper provides a unique validation against both an experimental reinforced concrete (RC) building and a calibrated numerical model to delineate the capability of the model-free HLA method and the adaptive least mean squares (LMS) model-based method in detecting, localizing and quantifying damage that may not be visible, observable in overall structural response. Results clearly show the model-free HLA method is capable of adapting to changes in how structures transfer load or demand across structural elements over time and multiple events of different size. However, the adaptive LMS model-based method presented an image of greater spread of lesser damage over time and story when the baseline model is not well defined. Finally, the two algorithms are tested over a simpler hysteretic behaviour typical steel structure to quantify the impact of model mismatch between the baseline model used for identification and the actual response. The overall results highlight the need for model-based methods to have an appropriate model that can capture the observed response, in order to yield accurate results, even in small events where the structure remains linear.","2017-02-01","2018-02-21 12:52:37","2018-02-21 12:52:37","","384-398","","","84, Part A","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filter; Damage identification; Hysteresis loop analysis; Model-based; Reinforced concrete experimental structure; Structural health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to profile trainees using serious games can yield new analytics and insights towards training and learning performance improvement, including the identification of weaknesses or potential training needs in the players towards adaptive training, and the creation of new diagnostics for prescriptive training, retraining, and remediation. Similarity measures of players' in-game course of actions (COAs) have been shown to be a viable approach in differentiating novices from experts in serious games. In this study, we examined and compared several popular similarity measures to see if any measure, or combination of measures, would be viable in differentiating players based on their {GAD} profiles in serious games. Our findings revealed that similarity measures, while significant in their predicting abilities individually, could gain more strength from one another in combination. More research is needed to create or develop new metrics and methods for players’ action and behavioral profiling in Serious Games Analytics.","2016","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","562 - 574","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the publicly available codes, the model input files are heterogeneous, making the creation of multiple models tedious. An enhanced method of creating model files and a method to easily create multiple models, may increase the number of comparison studies. HydraLens simplifies the creation of model files for four strong gravitational lens model software packages, including Lenstool, Gravlens/Lensmodel, glafic and PixeLens, using a custom-designed {GUI} for each of the four codes that simplifies the entry of the model for each of these codes, obviating the need for user manuals to set the values of the many flags and in each data field. HydraLens is designed in a modular fashion, which simplifies the addition of other strong gravitational lens codes in the future. HydraLens can also translate a model generated for any of these four software packages into any of the other three. Models created using HydraLens may require slight modifications, since some information may be lost in the translation process. However the computer-generated model greatly simplifies the process of developing multiple lens models. HydraLens may enhance the number of direct software comparison studies and also assist in the education of young investigators in gravitational lens modeling. Future development of HydraLens will further enhance its capabilities.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","28 - 34","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer-assisted","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study identifies essential competencies for caring for high-needs patients and highlights their importance to primary care delivery. Methods Transcripts of in-depth interviews with 30 clinical and administrative staff at 23 complex care programs across the United States were analyzed using standard qualitative techniques. Selected programs had several years of experience in serving patients with multiple chronic conditions, serious mental illness, substance use disorders, severe poverty, and homelessness. These programs exemplified diverse models (assertive community treatment, housing first, behavioral health, high utilizer), and all of them shared the common element of integrating primary care into their services. Results Competencies, including those known and taught in other fields, have distinctive application to informing delivery of high quality primary care to populations with complex needs, including: motivational interviewing for establishing patients’ priorities and helping them improve their health on their own terms; trauma-informed care for modifying primary care procedures to mitigate the ill-effects of prior trauma prevalent in this population; and harm reduction for altering medical regimens to accommodate constraints on what patients are able or willing to do. Other capabilities, cultivated by these programs, include empathizing with patients, promoted by exposure to simulations of patient experiences (e.g., hearing voices); as well as withholding judgment and counteracting patient passivity to foster open discussion of treatment plans. Conclusions Absence of deliberate attention to equipping providers with specific competencies for caring for high-needs patients may contribute to lack of patient engagement and sub-optimal outcomes, ultimately undermining the success of programs serving these populations.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students were randomly assigned to an experimental condition with demonstration and review videos and control condition with only demonstration videos. Video activity was logged to collect engagement data (coverage and commitment), and a knowledge and performance test were administered. The data showed that the videos were successful at gaining and maintaining the motivation and attention of students. Knowledge scores were moderate and there was no main effect for condition. Regression analysis showed overall coverage and review commitment were predictors for knowledge scores. Performance scores remained high when compared to the previous cohort, however there was a significant positive difference in the current study. There was no main effect for condition on performance scores. The DBT-model and its implementation in the videos was considered successful. In addition, it is suggested that video instruction can play an important role in statistics courses where theory and practice are separated.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-06 16:58:11","","475 - 485","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A daily diary design was carried out with 121 late-middle- and old-aged job seekers attending 10 computer cram schools. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire, seven daily diary questionnaires, and seven daily end-of-class computer skills examinations over the course of 1 week (N = 121∗7 = 847 occasions). The results of multi-level analyses showed that 1) computer self-efficacy is positively related to learning performance, 2) computer self-efficacy is positively related to learning engagement, 3) learning engagement is positively related to learning performance, and 4) learning engagement fully mediates the relationship between computer self-efficacy and learning performance.

This mutual behavioral dependency has been at the center of psychological studies of human communication for decades. Quantitative descriptors of the degree of entrainment can provide psychologists an objective method to advance studies of human communication including in mental health domains. However, the subtle nature of the entrainment phenomenon makes it challenging for computing such an effect based on just human annotations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised signal-derived approach within a principal component analysis framework for quantifying one aspect of entrainment in communication, namely, vocal entrainment. The proposed approach to quantify the degree of vocal entrainment involves measuring the similarity of specific vocal characteristics between the interlocutors in a dialog. These quantitative descriptors were analyzed using two psychology-inspired hypothesis tests to not only establish that these signal-derived measures carry meaningful information in interpersonal communication but also offer statistical evidence into aspects of behavioral dependency and associated affective states in marital conflictual interactions. Finally, affect recognition experiments were performed with the proposed vocal entrainment descriptors as features using a large database of real distressed married couples’ interactions. An accuracy of 62.56% in differentiating between positive and negative affect was obtained using these entrainment measures with Factorial Hidden Markov Models lending further support that entrainment is an active component underlying affective processes in interactions.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:48","2018-02-06 16:57:48","","518 - 539","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dyadic interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to understand and explain student engagement, some theories and models have been developed. The Campus-Class-Technology (CCT) Theory is one of these theories. The theory tries to explain the relationships between student engagement and technology theoretically. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of technology on student engagement and to examine the relationships between student engagement and technology use in class. For this purpose, the {CCT} Theory was tested with path analysis. The study was designed with the causal research method. The research sample was made up of 332 teacher students. Demographic Variables Form, Student Engagement Scale and Tendency Scale for Technology Use in Class were used as data collection tools. As a result of the analyses conducted regarding the test model, it was found out that the variables of valuing and belonging predicted emotional engagement while emotional engagement predicted behavioral engagement; lastly, behavioral engagement predicted cognitive engagement. Within the scope of the model, technology was found to be one of the causes which predicted and increased class engagement. The results of the study revealed that use of technology in class and out of class increased student engagement or had a facilitator role in the development of student engagement. Also, based on the results obtained, several suggestions were put forward for implementation, for higher education institutions and for future research to increase student engagement.","2015","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","114 - 125","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","higher education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online social engagement, operationalized through concepts such as connectivity, social presence and social space has been an important topic of research in web based education for more than a decade. An important sub-text of this research is that online social engagement supports higher levels of collaboration. Students who feel comfortable with and connected to their online learning community are much more likely to be active participants in that community, working together to develop and build knowledge systems. Much of this research refers to the more social/participatory based educational theories of John Dewey and L.S. Vygotsky. There is though a second component of collaboration that helps drive community building in this theoretical frameworks; motivation to engage in a shared, relevant, goal oriented activity. While most theories on social engagement assume natural relationships between online social engagement and motivation to participate in a community, this relationship is not often discussed and examined very often. This paper specifically compares the relationship between classroom connectedness and motivation to share knowledge between students in a hybrid, web infused class and a more traditionally oriented class with a small web component. Analysis did find a highly significant relationship between connectedness and motivation to share knowledge in the hybrid class but not in the traditional class, suggesting an important relationship, but one based at least partially in targeted experience.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","333 - 342","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A modified FBLMS (MFBLMS) algorithm with guaranteed optimal steady state performance has been proposed, but the theoretical analysis on its convergence properties has not been presented. This paper analyzes the convergence behavior of the algorithm by using the theory of asymptotically equivalent matrices. The eigenvalues of the matrix controlling the convergence behavior is proven to have the tendency to be equally distributed, and a theoretical eigenvalue spread is derived based on the first-order autoregressive (AR) signal model, which is significantly lower than that of the time domain LMS (TDLMS) algorithm. Therefore the convergence speed of the MFBLMS is significantly higher than that of the TDLMS algorithm for colored reference signal. Simulations are carried out to validate the convergence behavior predicted from the theoretical analysis.","2017-03","2018-02-21 12:52:36","2018-02-21 12:52:36","","165-169","","","132","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filters; Convergence behavior; Eigenvalue distribution; Frequency-domain implementation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The determining factor in education reform is to declare the competence indicators of necessary educational behavior in primary and junior high school. In the reform process, for all domains, the enriched rate of competence indicators for educational materials and methods is very meaningful. Because educational materials and methods in different domains have their own style, we should evaluate these teaching materials separately. Thus, in this research we propose a novel {MCDM} (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) framework for evaluating, comparing, and improving the effectiveness of competence indicators in the various publications for teaching materials in primary school based on different viewpoints. The {ANP} (Analysis Network Process) weights are based on the {DEMA℡} technique with the {MCDM} method for resolving the problems of dependence and feedback among criteria. Then, a {VIKOR} technique with {ANP} weights is proposed for addressing and reducing the performance gaps for each criterion, thus hopefully improving, re-configuring and selecting the aspired Intelligent Assessment Systems (IAS) for teaching materials. An empirical study of Mandarin Chinese based on this system design of three publishers is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results can improve the efficiency and quality of the authored Mandarin Chinese teaching materials and may extend to other Learning Areas.","2011","2018-02-06 16:56:58","2018-02-06 16:56:58","","12168 - 12179","","10","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Core competence (CC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intended outcome of this increased IT-facilitated student engagement is to foster important skills such as critical thinking used in both academia and workplace environments. Critical thinking (CT) skills entails the ability(ies) of mental processes of discernment, analysis and evaluation to achieve a logical understanding. Critical thinking in the classroom as well as in the workplace is a central theme; however, with the dramatic increase of {IT} usage the mechanisms by which critical thinking is fostered and used has changed. This article presents the work and results of critical thinking in a virtual learning environment. We therefore present a web-based course and we assess in which parts of the course, and to what extent, critical thinking was perceived to occur. The course contained two categories of learning modules namely resources and interactive components. Critical thinking was measured subjectively using the {ART} scale. Results indicate the significance of “interactivity” in what students perceived to be critical-thinking-oriented versus online material as a resource. Results and opportunities that virtual environments present to foster critical thinking are discussed.","2012","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-21 12:00:12","","1608 - 1617","","5","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Assessment; Critical thinking; E-learning; information technology; Information technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Curriculum mining aimed at investigating the actual curriculum model by constructing the model from the students’ academic results. However, the discrepancy measurement between the observed behavior of students and the standard curriculum model remains some challenges. This study proposes a methodology to assess the curriculum based on the students’ behavior. First, aggregate profile clustering is used to categorize the students according to their learning paths. Second, sequence mining approach is applied to assess the sequence of learning path in conformity with the prior curriculum guideline. The study utilized Information Systems (IS) students’ data to test the effectivity of the methodology. Results from the implementation shows that the {IS} students can be grouped into three clusters that have different characteristics with respect to their performance and learning behavior. It is also found that students with relatively high {GPA} tend to take the course earlier than the curriculum design. Meanwhile, students with relatively low {GPA} finish their study longer than eight semesters due to registering many courses after the designated semester. The results can be analyzed further to detect bottleneck and determine possible improvement on the curriculum.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","264 - 273","","","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","curriculum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cyber-volunteering activities have become more aggressive with the availability of social media in recent years. The objective of this paper is to discuss voluntary behavior in fulfilling {NGO} social missions through social media usage based on affordance theory. There is substantial literature discussing social media affordances in the context of enterprise organization, but there has been less literature discussing the activities of {NGOs} in social media. Hence, seven key affordances derived from the enterprise organization were used in the context of {NGO} working behavior, visibility, editability, persistence, virtual collaboration, synthetic representation, individualized, and collective. This research applies a qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews with 25 {NGO} members from seven selected Islamic {NGOs} in Malaysia that are active in different fields of Islamic education. The interviews focus on social media affordances that have influenced the execution of social missions in the NGOs. Data was analyzed using thematic coding based on the seven identified key social media affordances. The results suggest that the social media affordances related to cyber-volunteering are achieved through promoting, training, fundraising, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving activities. These affordances are highly influenced by cyber-volunteering behavior through work culture and personal privacy. The collective, individualized, and visibility affordances are most associated with cyber-volunteering behavior, followed by persistence, virtual collaboration, and editability, and synthetic representation is found to be the least.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:41","2018-02-06 16:58:41","","388 - 397","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WhatsApp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the various forms of botnet, DGA-based botnets, which utilize a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to avoid detection, are one of the most disruptive and difficult to detect. In such botnets, the {DGA} is used to generate a huge list of candidate Command and Control (C&amp;C) server domains, and the bot then attempts to connect to an active C&amp;C server by querying each {DNS} server in turn. DGA-based botnets are highly elusive and difficult to detect using traditional defensive mechanisms and therefore have a high survivability. Accordingly, this study proposes a DGA-based botnet detection scheme designated as {DBod} based on an analysis of the query behavior of the {DNS} traffic. The proposed scheme exploits the fact that hosts compromised by the same DGA-based malware query the same sets of domains in the domain list and most of these queries fail since only a very limited number of the domains are actually associated with an active C&amp;C. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated using the {DNS} data collected from an education network environment over a period of 26 months. The results show that {DBod} provides an accurate and effective means of detecting both existing and new DGA-based botnet patterns in real-world networks.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","1 - 15","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","network security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are, however, important differences between decision-making and action selection. According to “Two Minds” (Evans &amp; Frankish, 2009; Kahneman, 2003; Kahneman, 2011) – a version of dual processing theory – human behavior can be viewed as the integration of output of System 1, i.e., unconscious automatic processes, and System 2, i.e., conscious deliberate processes. System 1 activates a sequence of automatic actions. System 2 monitors System 1’s performance according to the plan it has created and, at the same time, it activates future possible courses of actions. Decision-making narrowly refers to System 2’s slow functions for planning for the future and related deliberate activities, e.g., monitoring, for future planning. On the other hand, action selection refers to integrated activities including not only System 1’s fast activities but also System 2’s slow activities, not separately but integrally. This paper further discusses the difference between decision-making and action selection on the basis of the architecture model the authors have developed for simulating human beings’ in situ action selection, Model Human Processor with Realtime Constraints (MHP/RT) (Kitajima &amp; Toyota, 2012b). MHP/RT’s simulation of human behavior along the time dimension shows when the processes of decision-making and action selection would be initiated and how they are carried out.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","82 - 93","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Two Minds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employed a decision tree algorithm to conduct classification analysis to find the relationship between the average numbers of cigarette use per day. The results showed that the most important explanatory variable for prediction of the average number of cigarette use per day is the age when first started smoking cigarettes every day, followed by education level, and psychological distress.

Both quantitative and qualitative investigations have been conducted to study specifically the impact of learners' conflict resolution on their deeper learning as measured by knowledge convergence (KC). Knowledge convergence refers the similarity between team members' post-collaboration knowledge representations derived through interaction. To compute learners' KC, team members' post-collaboration individual maps were compared through Pathfinder analysis. Contrary to prior research findings, increased conflict negotiation behaviors by an individual resulted in fewer similarities between his or her second map and other members' maps. Theme analysis revealed both effective interaction strategies and challenges that impacted triad team members' attainment of KC. Findings from this study can inform development of effective instructional support to cultivate the occurrence of deeper learning within the contexts of collaborative concept mapping and healthcare education.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The employed {DEM} modeling methodology is verified with the experimental results and {FEM} prediction of the pattern of shear bands developed through a trap-door centrifuge model test. Regarding the engineering aspects, a parametric study is carried out and the obtained results from the {DEM} simulations are compared with the experimental results. Concerning the fundamental aspects, various micro and macro aspects of shear banding, such as void ratio and coordination number, the evolution of particle-scale energies and second order work within the localized areas along the shear bands are studied. Moreover, a link is established between the micro and macro events occurring inside the shear bands. Regarding the engineering results, the analyses show that the reverse fault ruptures may deviate toward the hanging wall or footing wall, depending on the faulting angle; however, the primary and secondary normal fault ruptures refract at the soil–bedrock interface, deviating toward the hanging wall. Regarding the fundamental results, the analyses show that the pre-failure disintegration of strong contacts whose directions are aligned between the minimum principal strain and zero-extension line directions within the localized areas plays a fundamental role in the development of shear bands at micro scale. This leads to the local rotation (buckling) of columnar chains within shear bands at failure, being associated with a softening behavior, development of large voids, generation of high particle rotation gradients, rapid decrease of internal energy and rapid increase of dissipated energy within the shear bands at macro scale. In addition, the rolling mechanism plays a significant role in energy dissipation within the shear bands even though the sliding mechanism has a dominant role. Furthermore, the second order work becomes negative within the localized areas by the occurrence of shear banding.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","221 - 236","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zero-extension line","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So much so the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) has included problematic video gaming as disorder categorized as Internet Gaming Disorder. The field of applied behavior analysis has been utilizing functional assessments for the last 30 years and has showed evidence of effective results across different populations and environments. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation (comprising three studies) was to validate an indirect functional assessment entitled the Video Game Functional Assessment-Revised (VGFA-R). Using academic experts in the field of video game addiction and applied behavioral analysis (n = 6), the first study examined the content validity of the VGFA-R and was able to demonstrate the assessment exceeded the criterion for an established assessment. A second study comprising a survey of 467 gamers examined the factorability by using a confirmatory factor analysis, and found that VGFA-R had an overall variance above .60. Within the third laboratory-based study using gamers (n = 11), the VGFA-R was examined for construct validity and found the VGFA-R was able to predict 85% of the appropriate function of behavior. Implications of the study are discussed along with the strengths and limitations of the study and future research directions.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","501 - 510","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Internet gaming disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Children with {T1DM} (N = 27) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which they played a diabetes mellitus self-management education (DMSE) game, namely a diabetes quiz, with a personal or neutral robot on three occasions at the clinic, or were allocated to a control group (care as usual). Personalised robot behaviour was based on the self-determination theory (SDT), focusing on the children's needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy. The {SDT} determinants pleasure, motivation and diabetes knowledge were measured. Child-robot interaction was observed, including level of engagement. Results Results showed an increase in diabetes knowledge in children allocated to the robot groups and not in those allocated to the control group (P = .001). After three sessions, children working with the personal robot scored higher for determinants of {SDT} than children with the neutral robot (P = .02). They also found the robot to be more pleasurable (P = .04), they answered more quiz questions correctly (P = .02), and were more motivated to play a fourth time (P = .03). The analysis of audio/video recordings showed that in regard to engagement, children with the personal robot were more attentive to the robot, more social, and more positive (P &lt; .05). Conclusion The study showed how a personal robot that plays {DMSE} games and applies {STD} based strategies (i.e., provides constructive feedback, acknowledges feelings and moods, encourages competition and builds a rapport) can help to improve health literacy in children in an pleasurable, engaging and motivating way. Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children with a chronic disease and help them to cope with their illness.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","63 - 76","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioural theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing research has given considerable information about students’ alternative conceptions and faulty mental models about abstract programming concepts and constructs, as well as their difficulties in solving programming problems. Various algorithm visualization systems are proposed as alternative and efficient instructional environments for introductory programming courses. They include dynamic features, based on animation techniques, aiming at illustrating the behavior of basic algorithms and fostering students’ experimentation and algorithmic knowledge construction. This paper presents DAVE, a web-based dynamic algorithm visualization environment designed to support secondary education students’ learning about basic algorithms. {DAVE} facilitates students’ experimentation with array algorithms by allowing the modification of both code and data. The presentation of preliminary results, obtained from an evaluation study, provided evidence of the usability of the system and its potential to support students’ development of efficient mental models regarding basic array algorithms.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","229 - 239","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","web-based learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using the Value Sensitive Design framework we illustrate how a working compromise among the seemingly conflicting values involved can be found. The value mix used and the resulting concept informs solar proponents in siting solar in culturally sensitive ways and shows the heritage constituency that solar technology does not categorically mean a misfit with cultural heritage.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","162 - 183","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","value sensitive design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper enumerates a novel method of finding the modal parameters of a rolling tyre using an Explicit Finite Element Analysis and Operational Modal Analysis (OMA). ABAQUS Explicit, a commercial Finite Element (FE) software code has been used to simulate the experiment, a tyre rolling over a semi-circular straight and inclined cleat.

Accordingly, some studies indicate that empathy may play a determining role in the relationship between video games and aggression. In this context, the study aim was to describe the game types that middle school students play and analyze the relationship between the game types, their reactive and proactive aggressions, and empathic skills. Participants were 318 students from middle schools in Turkey. An important finding obtained from this study was the relationship between the frequency of proactive and reactive aggression and the playing of aggressive games; a relationship was also identified between emotional and cognitive empathy and the playing of aggressive games. Therefore, it is important to talk to children about the real-life consequences of aggressive games, and teach them appropriate methods of conflict management that they can use in real-life conflicts, which may diminish the negative effects of games with aggressive content.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","286 - 295","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Middle school students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous studies have shown the applicability of determining learner behaviors from an LMS, most investigated datasets are not assembled from online learning courses or from whole learning activities undertaken on courses that can be analyzed to evaluate students’ academic achievement. Previous studies generally focus on the construction of predictors for learner performance evaluation after a course has ended, and neglect the practical value of an “early warning” system to predict at-risk students while a course is in progress. We collected the complete learning activities of an online undergraduate course and applied data-mining techniques to develop an early warning system. Our results showed that, time-dependent variables extracted from {LMS} are critical factors for online learning. After students have used an {LMS} for a period of time, our early warning system effectively characterizes their current learning performance. Data-mining techniques are useful in the construction of early warning systems; based on our experimental results, classification and regression tree (CART), supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifier for the evaluation of learning performance investigated by this study.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:39","2018-02-21 13:14:07","","469 - 478","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data-mining; Early warning system; e-Learning; Learning management system; Learning performance prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environment, iSocial, is being developed to help youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) develop social competencies. The approach to identifying, classifying and coding behavior in the 3D VLE uses an adaptation of reciprocal interaction coding methods traditionally used in single-subject research with individuals with ASD. These adaptations consider the unique characteristics of the 3D VLE technology and the nature and context of learning in this type of environment. A description of the coding methods employed is provided. Selected results are presented to illustrate how this methodology can offer detailed descriptions of learning and social interaction behavior in context. Such results demonstrate the potential of this approach for building new knowledge about how learning takes place and progresses in a 3D VLE and for making data-driven design decisions for improving the learning experience in the online social context.","2012-03","2018-02-21 11:55:33","2018-02-21 11:55:33","","405-413","","2","28","","Computers in Human Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","All-views analysis; Autism spectrum disorders; Multi-user virtual learning environments (MUVEs); Social competency curriculum; Three-dimensional virtual learning environments (3D VLE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far much of this research has been carried out in isolation and the focus on roles lacks cohesion. In this article we present a conceptual framework to synthesise the contemporary conceptualisation of roles, by discerning three levels of the role concept: micro (role as task), meso (role as pattern) and macro (role as stance). As a first step to further conceptualise ‘role as a stance’, we present a framework of eight participative stances defined along three dimensions: group size, orientation and effort. The participative stances – Captain, Over-rider, Free-rider, Ghost, Pillar, Generator, Hanger-on and Lurker – were scrutinised on two data sets using qualitative analysis. The stances aim to facilitate meaningful description of student behaviour, stimulate both teacher and student awareness of roles at the macro-level in terms of participative stances, and evaluate or possibly change the participation to collaborative learning on all levels.","2010","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","495 - 505","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","higher education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consolidated systems are defined as being stable at the original state, but due to fuzzy variations in their inputs or parameters tend to react accordingly in a manner leading to maintaining their consolidity and strength, or vice versa. Under the new theory, systems are classified into consolidated, neutrally consolidated or unconsolidated type based on their output fuzziness reaction to combined input and parameters fuzziness action. The systems’ Consolidity Theory is demonstrated by several examples of mathematical functions of different dimensionalities, control theory and Predator-Prey populations’ dynamics. The suggested Consolidity Theory is illustrated to be an effective tool for revealing the inner property of systems and predicting their hidden behavior when operating in fully fuzzy environment. Monitoring and control of systems’ consolidity through forward and backward fuzziness tracking are suggested during systems’ operation, for avoiding their drifting to possible unwanted unconsolidated domains. It is shown that the analysis will lead at the end to determining the system’s consolidity index that could be regarded as a general basic internal property of the system. Such systems’ consolidity concept can also be defined far from fuzzy logic, and is applicable to the analysis and design of various types of linear, nonlinear, multivariable, dynamic, etc., systems in real life in the fields of basic sciences, evolutionary systems, engineering, biology, medicine, economics, finance, political and management sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education.","2012","2018-02-06 16:59:01","2018-02-06 16:59:01","","1191 - 1199","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems’ Consolidity Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We allow each node in the network to use information from multi-hop neighbors to approximate a global cost function accurately. By minimizing this cost and dividing multi-hop range summation into 1-hop range combination steps, we derive new diffusion LMS algorithms. The resulting distributed algorithms consist of adaptation and multi-combination step. Multi combination allows each node to use information from non-adjacent nodes at each time instant, thereby reducing steady-state error. We analyzed the output to derive stability conditions and to quantify the transient and steady-state behaviors. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms have lower steady-state error compared to the conventional diffusion LMS algorithms.

This data exploration is intended not to validate pre-defined questions or specific goals (for example, a comparison between engagement and academic scores) but to discover usage trends and obtain insights about users’ usage of the system and their knowledge of and proficiency with the available resources and features. The engagement indicators and knowledge obtained from the analysis of these indicators regarding the users of the system, their desires, and their competencies with virtual resources will facilitate decision-making and planning by managers of the Virtual World to improve system adoption and learning effectiveness, correct usage mistakes, perform actions to enhance user exploitation of available features, and provide information to users on system usage. This knowledge and the actions based on it are capital in an eLearning ecosystem such as an Educational Virtual World, where students are able to perform tasks in 3D at any time or location without supervision.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","18 - 25","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Educational Virtual Worlds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While current approaches address a number of challenges such as quality of service, live migration and fault tolerance, which is of increasing importance, refers to the embedding of users’ and applications’ behaviour in the management processes of Clouds. The latter will allow for accurate estimation of the resource provision (for certain levels of service quality) with respect to the anticipated users’ and applications’ requirements. In this paper we present a two-level generic black-box approach for behavioral-based management across the Cloud layers (i.e., Software, Platform, Infrastructure): it provides estimates for resource attributes at a low level by analyzing information at a high level related to application terms (Translation level) while it predicts the anticipated user behaviour (Behavioral level). Patterns in high-level information are identified through a time series analysis, and are afterwards translated to low-level resource attributes with the use of Artificial Neural Networks. We demonstrate the added value and effectiveness of the Translation level through different application scenarios: namely {FFMPEG} encoding, real-time interactive e-Learning and a Wikipedia-type server. For the latter, we also validate the combined level model through a trace-driven simulation for identifying the overall error of the two-level approach.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","27 - 40","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Workload prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics.","2016-09-22","2018-02-21 12:20:30","2018-02-21 12:20:30","","106-110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algorithm design and analysis; Big Data; Big data; Big-Data Analysis; Big Data analytics; Clickstream Data; Collaboration; collaborative learning environment; Collaborative Programming; Collaborative work; computer-based learning system; computer science education; computer science learning; Computer-supported Collaborative Learning; computer-supported collaborative learning; course assignment development; CSCL; data analysis; data visualisation; early-stage engagement; Education; educational courses; IDE; interaction log recording; Internet; learner behaviors; learner engagement rate measurement; learner knowledge construction; learning analytics; Learning Analytics; learning management systems; Programming; programming environments; Software; software project development and insight learning environment; SPDI learning environment; visualization dashboard; Web-based integrated development environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Educational Innovation through Technology (EITT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, academic institutions and faculty are increasingly using social networking sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, to connect with current and potential students and to deliver instructional content. This has led to a rise in questions about the impact of {OSN} on academic performance and the possibility of using it as an effective teaching tool. To learn more about the impact on academic performance, we conducted a survey of business students at a large state university. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed a statistically significant negative relationship between time spent by students on {OSN} and their academic performance. The time spent on {OSN} was found to be heavily influenced by the attention span of the students. Specifically, we determined that the higher the attention span, the lower is the time spent on OSN. Further, attention span was found to be highly correlated with characteristics that predict or influence student behavior, such as their perceptions about society’s view of social networking, their likes and dislikes of OSN, ease of use of OSN, etc.","2012","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","2117 - 2127","","6","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the course of the closed-loop operation, a larger surge current may be induced, and this current can cause the equipped over-current protection take action incorrectly. In this paper, a flux-coupling type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is suggested to suppress the surge current caused by the closed-loop operation. The structure and principle of the suggested {SFCL} are introduced, and considering the SFCL′s current-limiting impedance, the mathematical process for calculation of the surge current is presented. Furthermore, according to the simulation analysis of a practical 10 kV power distribution network integrated with the SFCL, the surge current′s dynamic characteristics and the SFCL′s performance behaviors are both assessed. From the demonstrated results, the SFCL′s positive effects on reducing the surge current and improving the system′s robustness against the closed-loop operation can be verified. At the last of the paper, a few technical discussions regarding the SFCL′s engineering application are conducted, and some useful conclusions related to the practicability of experimentally building the {SFCL} are obtained. {PACS} codes: 85.25.Am; 84.30.Jc.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:02","2018-02-06 16:59:02","","160 - 166","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Power distribution system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, we use a nonparametric (Data Envelopment Analysis) model that is specially tailored to assess educational efficiency at the pupil level. The model accounts for the fact that typically minimal prior structure is available for the behavior (objectives and feasibility set) under evaluation. It allows for uncertainty in the data, while it corrects for exogenous ‘environmental’ characteristics that are specific to each pupil. Secondly, we propose two multidimensional stochastic dominance criteria as naturally complementary aggregation criteria for comparing the performance of different school types (private and public schools). While the first criterion only accounts for efficiency, the second criterion also takes equity into consideration. The model is applied for comparing private (but publicly funded) and public primary schools in Flanders. Our application finds that no school type robustly dominates another type when controlling for the school environment and taking equity into account. More generally, it demonstrates the usefulness of our nonparametric approach, which includes environmental and equity considerations, for obtaining ‘fair’ performance comparisons in the public sector context.","2010","2018-02-06 16:57:33","2018-02-06 16:57:33","","563 - 573","","2","202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nonparametric analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis is carried out by discrete crack model using the multi-region 3D boundary element method including material damping. To account for the decay of joint strength parameters at intermediate courses of deformation, the simplified discrete crack joint model (SDCJ) has been used. The nonlinear nature of contact problems demands an iterative technique development to determine the actual contact conditions (opening and sliding with bonding and friction) at arbitrary points of the contact boundaries. Through several analyses, it is demonstrated that the proposed method is robust, as it does not require to solve the whole system simultaneously. As a particular case, the influence of foundation inhomogeneity on the seismic response of concrete arch dam has been studied in order to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the present approach in a complicated case.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","320 - 328","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete crack","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many learners’ characteristics may be considered to provide personalized learning that fit into individual’s needs. Understanding individual differences in learning is an important issue in educational psychology. Many studies attest that learning process can be more effective by considering personality traits. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy inference system, ALPIS, to identify the Big-Five Personality from learner’s network behaviors. The proposed system had been implemented through {MATLAB} fuzzy tools. We conducted an experimental study in real e-learning environment with 53 students (29 male and 24 female) to evaluate the {ALPIS} performance. Comparing to the conventional inventory-based psychological analysis (NEO-FFI) we demonstrate that learners’ personality can be predicted with reasonable precision based on their online behaviors. Experiments have shown that {ALPIS} is able to automatically detect learners’ personality with accuracy at least 78% on medium Agreeableness category and 97% on low extroversion category. Because of using learners’ behaviors {ALPIS} provides a reasonable precision in personality detection.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","42 - 52","","","51, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALPIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By considering the underlying processes of imagery, spatial presence, copresence and flow, we analyse how interactivity affects users’ responses towards the learning environment, including their actual continuance behaviour. We validate our conceptual model by using survey and registrar data obtained from 2530 students of an open, distance university in the European Higher Education Area. The results suggest that the interactivity elicited by an e-learning environment unleashes imagery that in turn facilitates spatial presence and copresence as well as flow. Significant paths are also found from interactivity to flow and from flow to e-learner response variables (attitude, intention to continue and actual continuance behaviour). The paper provides a novel account of the presence and flow-enabling mechanisms in e-learning and offers novel knowledge on how higher education institutions can facilitate e-learners’ continuance behaviour.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-06 16:58:11","","504 - 516","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copresence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To unlock this data it is important to gain the trust of the companies that hold the data as well as showing them how they may benefit from this research. Part of this trust is gained through established reputation and the other through the technology used to safeguard the data. This paper discusses how different technology frameworks have been applied to safeguard the data and facilitate collaborative work between commercial concerns and academic institutions. The paper focuses on the distinctive requirements of e-Social Science: access to large-scale data on behaviour in society in environments that impose confidentiality constraints on access. These constraints arise from both privacy concerns and the commercial sensitivities of that data. In particular, the paper draws on the experiences of building an intercontinental Grid–INWA–from its first operation connecting Australia and Scotland to its subsequent extension to China across the Trans-Eurasia Information Network–the first large-scale research and education network for the Asia–Pacific region. This allowed commercial data to be analysed by experts that were geographically distributed across the globe. It also provided an entry point for a major Chinese commercial organisation to approve use of a Grid solution in a new collaboration provided the centre of gravity of the data is retained within the jurisdiction of the data owner. We describe why, despite this approval, an embedded solution was eventually adopted. We find that ‘data sovereignty’ dominates any decision on whether and how to participate in e-Social Science collaborations and how this might impact on a Cloud based solution to this type of collaboration.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","1120 - 1129","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data sovereignty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community {OR} can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has shown that emotions can influence human behavior and learning abilities, as a result developers of tutoring systems have also started to follow these ideas by creating affective tutoring systems. However, adaptation skills of the mentioned type of systems are still imperfect. The paper presents an analysis of emotion recognition methods used in existing systems to enhance ongoing research on the improvement of tutoring adaptation. Regardless of the method chosen, the achievement of accurate emotion recognition requires collecting ground-truth data. To provide ground-truth data for emotional states, the authors have implemented a self-assessment method based on Self-Assessment Manikin.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-06 16:58:06","","437 - 444","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Self-Assessment Manikin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, projects collecting emotion-related data are proliferating, like social networks sentiment analysis or tracking students’ engagement to reduce Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) drop out rates. All them require a common way to represent emotions so it can be more easily integrated, shared and reused by applications improving user experience. Due to the complexity of this data, our proposal is to use rich semantic models based on ontology. EmotionsOnto is a generic ontology for describing emotions and their detection and expression systems taking contextual and multimodal elements into account. The ontology has been applied in the context of EmoCS, a project that collaboratively collects emotion common sense and models it using the EmotionsOnto and other ontologies. Currently, emotion input is provided manually by users. However, experiments are being conduced to automatically measure users’s emotional states using Brain–Computer Interfaces.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","610 - 617","","","51, Part B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","affective computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used a quantitative approach seeking a causative explanation of the decision behavior of individuals toward the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in academic settings. A survey of 286 participants (students) was conducted to collect the research data. Our study framework was based on the third version of the Technology Acceptance Model (i.e., TAM3) and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling in order to determine the factors that influence the learners’ intention to use e-learning. Results show the predicting (promoting/inhibiting) factors of e-learning technology acceptance, while also examining some related post-implementation interventions expected to contribute to the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems. Our results also indicate that {TAM3} holds well in the Arabian culture and also outline valuable outcomes such as: managerial interventions and controls for better organizational e-learning management that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization. Hopefully, this study provides a roadmap to more understanding of the success factors and post-implementation interventions contributing to the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems in developing countries.","2016","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-21 13:14:32","","27 - 50","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","E-learning; LMS; Structural equation modeling; TAM; TAM3; Technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Concept Development Process (CDP) model is proposed to help guide engineers, analysts, and developers in the development of the persona concept and its integration into the requirements engineering process. The objectives of the proposed {CDP} model are 1) to enhance the requirements engineering process by incorporating the persona concept into the requirements engineering activities to enable engineers, analysts, and developers gain a better understanding of users’ needs and behaviors early in the requirements engineering process and 2) to identify missing requirements early in the requirements engineering process by examining the relationships of personas with scenarios, tasks, goals, and requirements applied in a web application domain.

Alike, incorporation of cross-border trips have been an integral part of transportation demand models through external surveys. The present study seeks to explore the Incoming Cross Border Traffic (ICBT) into a study area based on the characteristics of a study area that attracts cross-border trips from outside region. This paper presents an analysis of cross-border trips in Karachi Metropolis, largest city of Pakistan, through Household Individual Survey (HIS-2010) and land use data from alternative resources. Results reveal that land use particulars, socioeconomic characteristics and travel attributes of individuals significantly influences cross-border trips and this effect varies spatially.

Each session was 10 minutes in length. During the classes, the number of eye blinks was recorded for each student by using special software. After completing the {PBL} classes, the students answered questionnaires. Then the results were analyzed. All of the results suggested that the difficult question would make students’ feelings unstable and increase the number of eye blinks.

Nevertheless, many professional virtual communities (PVC) have failed due to reasons, such as the low willingness of members to share knowledge with other members. In addition, it is not explicitly evident whether knowledge sharing in information security is able to reduce risk. To date, there have been relatively few empirical studies concerning the effects of knowledge sharing and its capability to reduce risk in information security communities. This paper proposes a model that is composed of two main parts. The first part is the Triandis theory, which is adapted to understand and foster the determinants of knowledge sharing behavior in PVCs. The second part explores the quantitative relationship between knowledge sharing and security risk reduction expectation. One hundred and forty-two members from the LinkedIn information security groups participated in this study. {PLS} analysis shows that perceived consequences, affect, and facilitating conditions have significant effects on knowledge sharing behavior. In contrast, social factors have shown insignificant effects on knowledge sharing behavior in information security communities. The results of the study demonstrate that there is a positive and strong relationship between knowledge sharing behavior and information security risk reduction expectation.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","19 - 34","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Professional virtual community","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With WebChoice patients can monitor their symptoms, obtain individually tailored, evidence-based self-management support, ask questions to a clinical nurse specialist, communicate with other patients in a Forum, and use a diary. Methods To better understand what components were most helpful, we analyzed user logs of breast and prostate cancer patients who participated in the experimental arm of an {RCT} to test effects of WebChoice on clinical outcomes. Patients could freely use the system for one year. After 6 months into the study, participants received questionnaires asking about reasons for using the different WebChoice components and their usefulness. Results 103 (64%) patients actively used WebChoice, on average 60 times. The Forum and asking questions to the nurse were used the most, yet there were large individual variations in use patterns. Also, patients used different WebChoice components for different reasons. The e-mail communication with nurses was valued highest. Discussion Differences were found between breast and prostate cancer patients and between patients with a first time diagnosis and metastases or recurrences. The large variations among patients in their use of WebChoice components demonstrate that patients’ needs for support vary. Conclusion The use patterns and patients’ appraisals of usefulness in this study provide important insights into cancer patients’ information and communication behavior that are important for further improvements and the design of eHealth applications for illness management support.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","593 - 603","","7","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Self-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to enhance the motivation and learning efficiency for students attending a course in financial management. A web-based virtual stock trading (VST) system, embedded with provided functions for financial ratio analysis, was designed to simulate a stock trading environment. Through learning with objective financial analyses, the state of learners’ minds is expected not to be affected by news or market fluctuations, which in turn nurtures the students as rational investors. Students were recruited from two universities located in central Taiwan for this study. They were given a virtual budget at the beginning of the semester for online virtual trading. The stock trading behavior, such as risk aversion and disposition effect, was explored through students’ trading histories. Furthermore, the learning outcome was evaluated with analysis of trading performance based on five indicators, including returns on budget, stock’s trading amount turnover, profit margin of stock trading amount, average budget utilization rate, and returns on average investment amount. Finally, perceived usefulness and behavior intention of the {VST} system were surveyed using a questionnaire instrument based on the extended technical acceptance model (TAM). The analytic results support risk aversion theory in that students tended to sell high-priced stocks in short periods with a holding day of 4.03±4.93(N=32) because of its great price fluctuation even if its price was rising during the study period. In contrast, the holding days of high-priced stocks were significantly shorter than the stocks ( t -test, p &lt; 0.01 ) with lower prices (10.70±11.92,N=1136). At the end of the semester, questionnaires were disseminated to the 136 participating students, a total of 103 questionnaires were received with a response rate of 75.74%. The Cronbach’s Alpha value was as high as 0.88, indicating that the questionnaire achieved high reliability. It shows that perceived usefulness (4.39±0.53) and behavior intention (4.31±0.50) are significantly higher than the neutral value (3) at a level of 0.001 using one-sample t -test, showing that the {VST} system is useful and the students are willing to further adopt the system and recommend it to other users. After analyses of the received questionnaires with structural equation model (SEM), {TAM} was verified regarding the adoption of {VST} as a tool for financial management education. In conclusion, the proposed {VST} system is useful in financial management education, specific in stock trading, to provide students with knowledge and experience to profit from the stock market through active learning in a virtual trading environment.","2012","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-21 12:00:14","","1495 - 1505","","5","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Disposition effect; E-learning; experiential learning; Experiential learning; Risk aversion; Trading behavior; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to that, large settlement also occurs by a significant increase in soil permeability during seismic excitation. To properly simulate the post-liquefaction settlement, it is important to take the compressibility properties of the liquefied sand as well as the permeability increase into account. Using initial permeability coefficient in the course of simulation of liquefaction leads to underestimation of settlement. In addition to that, using unrealistic values for permeability may cause erroneous predictions of other aspects of soil behavior. Therefore, an accurate simulation of pore pressure generation and dissipation and consequent settlement during liquefaction requires incorporating the actual variation of permeability in the numerical model. In this paper, variation of soil permeability during liquefaction and its effects on soil seismic response is studied using a fully coupled dynamic analysis. Having a realistic mechanism for simulation of soil skeleton response using a well-calibrated critical state two-surface plasticity model, the focus of attention in this paper is on the effects of permeability variation on the behavior of liquefied grounds. Numerical simulations are performed using parts of Modified OpenSees Services (MOSS) library, a set of coupled finite elements, constitutive integration procedures, and material models from the {UC} Davis toolset along with a novel implementation of variable permeability. Two relationships are proposed for considering the variations of permeability coefficient in the process of liquefaction. The proposed relationships have been implemented into the model and applied for simulation of a centrifuge experiment. Comparison of the numerical results and experimental measurements reveals that there is a direct relationship between (variable) permeability coefficient and excess pore pressure ratio in all build-up, liquefaction, and dissipation phases.","2012","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","74 - 88","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Excess pore pressure ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It may be useful, for example, for sensitivity analysis of the initial postbuckling behavior of beams, arches, plates, and shells, and assemblies of such structures. The task of this work is to determine this percentage without computing insignificant numbers such as the values of the strain energy and its membrane part. It is hypothesized that this percentage is proportional to the acceleration of a fictitious particle, moving along a curve on the unit sphere. The curve is described by the vertex of the normalized “fundamental eigenvector” of the so-called “consistently linearized eigenvalue problem”. The proportionality factor is obtained from the initial condition for the “non-membrane” percentage of the strain energy, hypothesized as twice the initial velocity of the particle. The lower bound of this factor signals the constancy of this percentage with increasing load, whereas the upper bound indicates a monotonic increase or decrease up to its ab initio predictable value at a stability limit or to an unphysical asymptotic limiting value. The proof of the universal validity of the two hypotheses begins with their verification for the special cases of a membrane stress state and pure bending. The assertion that this is a sufficient condition for the universal validity of these hypotheses is subsequently verified for an example with a monotonically increasing “non-membrane” percentage of the strain energy. It is finally confirmed by an indirect proof of their validity for a non-monotonic course of this percentage. A by-product of this work are conditions for extreme values of the stiffness of structures, subjected to proportional loading.","2017","2018-02-06 16:59:01","2018-02-06 16:59:01","","74 - 109","","","324","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Extreme values of the structural stiffness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[1,2] has been extended. In the original model, postural coordination was treated as an eigenvalue–eigenvector problem between two segmental degrees of freedom represented by angular displacements of the trunk and shank. Strategies of postural coordination were then identified using the sign of the covariance between the two segments’ angular displacements. In contrast to the original model, the current model first subdivided the entire trial into smaller time segments, comprising four cycles of perturbation, i.e., a 16 s window. This window marched along the data advancing in 8.3 ms steps, each time performing the computation from the original model on the terms of the covariance matrix. The resulting time-segment-dependent postural strategies estimated the changes in posture control that took place over the course of the experiment. In addition to the statistical modeling, the auto-power spectrums and cross-spectral density function estimates for the entire trial, as well as for the individual time segments, were analyzed. In these experiments subjects experienced a 0.25 Hz sinusoidal perturbation of a platform while exposed to a virtual reality environment. The data we collected showed that the statistical and spectral characteristics across the entire trial may differ from individual time segments of the same trial indicating time-varying postural behavior. Comparison of these results from young and elderly subjects revealed that the time dependency observed in postural behavior was sensitive to aging. The young population managed to be consistent in their postural behavior throughout the entire trial and responded to the perturbation frequency with an out-of-phase response between the postural segments. Elderly subjects, however, demonstrated inconsistent postural behaviors as they switched back and forth between different postural coordination patterns within a trial.","2011","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","85 - 93","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Time dependency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no research has examined the use of self-guided iCBT, that is, treatment without contact with a clinician, specifically for older adults. The aim of the present study was to undertake a preliminary examination of the acceptability, efficacy and health economic impact of two entirely self-guided iCBT programs for adults over 60 years of age with anxiety and depression. Two separate single-group feasibility open trials of self-guided iCBT were conducted, the Anxiety Trial (n = 27) and the Depression Trial (n = 20), using the control groups of two randomized controlled trials. The online treatment packages consisted of five online educational lessons, which were delivered over 8 weeks without clinical contact. Participants rated the interventions as acceptable with more than 90% reporting the course was worth their time and more than 70% of participants completing at least 3 of the 5 lessons within the eight weeks. Significant reductions on measures of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GAD-7) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item; PHQ-9) were observed from pre-treatment to post-treatment in both the Anxiety Trial (GAD-7 Cohen's d = 1.17; 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.75) and the Depression Trial (PHQ-9 Cohen's d = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.73). The economic analyses indicated that there was statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life compared to baseline and marginally higher costs associated with treatment for both the Anxiety Trial ($69.84; 95% CI: $4.24 to $135.45) and the Depression Trial ($54.98; 95% CI: $3.84 to $106.12). The results provide preliminary support for the potential of entirely self-guided iCBT for older adults with anxiety and depression and indicate larger scale and controlled research trials are warranted.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","17 - 23","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cost and utility analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study found the discrepancies as well as similarities in the students’ patterns and themes of participation between online questions (student–instructor interaction) and online chat messages (student–students interaction or peer interaction). The results also identify disciplinary differences in students’ online participation. A correlation is found between the number of online questions students asked and students’ final grades. The data suggests that a combination of using data mining and text mining techniques for a large amount of online learning data can yield considerable insights and reveal valuable patterns in students’ learning behaviors. Limitations with data and text mining were also revealed and discussed in the paper.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:53","2018-02-06 16:57:53","","90 - 102","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","social interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines how {CBA} approaches were configured within and between modules, and the impact of assessment design on students' engagement, satisfaction, and pass rates. The analysis was conducted using a combination of longitudinal visualisations, correlational analysis, and fixed-effect models on 74 undergraduate modules and their 72,377 students. Our findings indicate that educators designed very different assessment strategies, which significantly influenced student engagement as measured by time spent in the virtual learning environment (VLE). Weekly analyses indicated that assessment activities were balanced with other learning activities, which suggests that educators tended to aim for a consistent workload when designing assessment strategies. Since most of the assessments were computer-based, students spent more time on the {VLE} during assessment weeks. By controlling for heterogeneity within and between modules, learning design could explain up to 69% of the variability in students' time spent on the VLE. Furthermore, assessment activities were significantly related to pass rates, but no clear relation with satisfaction was found. Our findings highlight the importance of {CBA} and learning design to how students learn online.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-21 13:54:48","","703 - 714","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic retention; Computer-based assessment; Learner satisfaction; Learning analytics; Learning design; virtual learning environment; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technology has long been used to enhance group learning, often known as Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Recent research in this area showed that technology somehow hinders the communication and interaction of group members. Therefore, as suggested by many researchers, introducing back the physical interaction could reduce these obstacles. Augmented Reality (AR) is the technology whereby the physical and virtual objects can co-exist in real time. The physical objects can be used to interact with the system. However, literature showed the number of the papers that explore the interaction and communication process which occurred while using {AR} to support group learning relatively low. Therefore, this paper is aimed to fulfill that gap. Conducting a science experiment on electricity topic was used as a case study. Eight groups of two students participated in this study. The primary data used in this study was collected from the analysis of video recording of students’ behavior as well as from the survey questionnaire on the user awareness of communication and interaction. The video were then annotated and coded to extract information by using Actogram2 software. Results showed that several types of natural interactions were exhibited. Both verbal and non-verbal communication cues were observed. Physical objects were the main interacting material that group members referred to and used. These results suggested the importance of incorporating physical objects in collaborative {AR} based system. Further, this study showed positive evidence to strengthen the raised conjuncture that {AR} could be one of the effective tools to support collaborative learning.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","144 - 153","","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","learning process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The web-based eTextbook infrastructure allows us to collect large amounts of data that can provide detailed information about students’ study behavior. In particular we were interested in seeing if the students will attempt to manipulate the electronic resources so as to receive credit without deeply going through the materials. We found that a majority of students do not read the text. On the other hand, we found evidence that students voluntarily complete additional exercises (after obtaining credit for completion) as a study aid prior to exams. We determined that visualization use was fairly high (even when credit for their completion was not offered). Skipping to the end of slideshows was more common when credit for their completion was offered, but also occurred when it was not. We measured the level of use of mobile devices for learning by {CS} students. Almost all students did not associate their mobile devices with studying. The only time they accessed OpenDSA from a mobile device was for a quick look up, and never for in depth study.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-06 16:57:19","","478 - 485","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","computing education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lag sequential analysis and interviews are adopted to explore the pattern transformation of the learners' meta-cognition behavior during the problem-solving tasks. The results show that different teaching methods and materials lead to differentiated metacognitive behaviors. Moreover, comparing to traditional instruction strategy, using 3D tangible object in cognitive-apprenticeship instruction stimulates more meta-cognition behaviors, further leads to successful problem-solving.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:36","2018-02-06 16:56:36","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","elearning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were collected from 342 Taiwanese high school students by utilizing two self-report instruments: the {ISEB} survey (including Uncertainty, Complexity and Self-Source of Internet-based knowledge as well as Justification for Internet-based knowing) and the {OAHS} questionnaire (containing Information Search, Formal Query and Informal Query in online information searching contexts). The results of the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as well as the alpha values indicated that both the {ISEB} and {OAHS} instruments possessed adequate validity and reliability. The path analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) further verified that students’ {ISEB} were related to their behaviors of online help seeking while undertaking academic tasks on the Internet. It is reported that students with naïve beliefs regarding Uncertainty, Complexity and Self-Source of Internet-based knowledge intended to conduct online information help seeking strategies (Uncertainty: Formal Query, Informal Query; Complexity: Information Search, Formal Query, Informal Query; Self-Source: Informal Query). For example, students with naïve beliefs in Uncertainty of Internet-based knowledge had a higher tendency to use help seeking relating to Formal Query and Informal Query. However, students who believed that course-related content on the Internet should be evaluated through different aspects of other sources (i.e., sophisticated beliefs regarding Justification for Internet-based knowing) were more likely to use Information Search and Informal Query online help seeking strategies.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:37","2018-02-06 16:58:37","","391 - 400","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Online academic help seeking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Internet applications used most frequently are online banking, information on market prices and yields of outputs, and weather forecasts. However, a large variation of the Internet behaviour is observed among the growers. The influence of personal characteristics (biographical and social characteristics, communication behaviour) and business size is examined on the use of five groups of Internet applications: general applications, basic management information, specialised management information, information on output prices and yields, and e-commerce. Data were collected at 163 horticultural businesses with Internet use for business purposes. Categorical principal component analysis of the explaining variables resulted in five dimensions. “Openness and active search for information” shows a significantly positive influence for all examined Internet applications, except for e-commerce. “Long-term perspectives of the business” is found to have a significantly positive influence on the use of general applications and e-commerce. E-commerce is also significantly influenced by the “attitude towards risks and environmentally friendly production techniques” and “agricultural or horticultural education, supplemented by additional courses”. “Larger businesses with the search for specific advice” is a dimension with a significantly positive effect on the use of specialised management information and e-commerce. For many Internet applications the personal attitudes of the business manager seem to be important, suggesting that developing human capital is crucial to increase the speed and coverage of Internet adoption.","2010","2018-02-06 16:57:28","2018-02-06 16:57:28","","369 - 379","","2","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","internet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we begin by highlighting the purpose of forums in {MOOCs} and its shortcomings such as quantity of participation, good set of resident or visiting experts, unregulated exchange of information and lack of auto answering. Then we turn our focus on analysing the data of successful Community Question and Answer (CQ&amp;A) sites such as Stack Overflow, Quora and Yahoo! Answers using data mining techniques. Based on what we learnt, we list features that are needed in {MOOC} forums. Finally, we also propose a forum footprint that can adjust dynamically based on community behaviour.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","530 - 537","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","discussion forums","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A quantitative experiment was conducted to verify if social competition increases cognitive load, engagement, interest, and subsequently learning. The 115 students played an educational videogame, specifically designed for this experiment using Minecraft, in single, one-versus-one, small group, or classroom settings. The results show significantly higher cognitive load induced through social competition; lowered focused attention, instructional efficiency; and no higher situational interest. Additionally, increased learning in the solo condition could be observed. In contrast to these results, analysis of the actual perceived challenge resulted in positive correlations with engagement, situational interest, and retention knowledge. After the analysis, a detailed discussion of the impacts of social competition and various implications and future directions are provided. For example, it is argued that it is important to distinguish between the added gameplay mechanic of social competition and the perceived intrapersonal challenge this induces. Whereas the first might increase cognitive load due to the monitoring of additional game states, the latter might foster motivation and interest.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-06 16:57:08","","384 - 398","","","55, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","interactive learning environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mining of {LMS} users’ data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way {LMS} users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the {LMS} use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle {LMS} users’ QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts’ contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the {LMS} use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of {HEIs} could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess {OLEs} stakeholders’ needs within the teaching and learning practices.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-21 13:14:15","","7399 - 7423","","21","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Blended learning; FCM-Viewer application; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs); Moodle Learning Management System; Quality of Interaction (QoI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In distance learning, teachers cannot directly observe student states and assess achievement concurrently. Many distance education studies adopted frequency of interaction as the basis of student participation when assessing the student achievements in class. However, the number of times a student interacts is not equal to discussion quality. Although synchronous discussions during class can help teachers assess learning states, these discussions are not suited to all courses. If a teacher can supervise student images from computer’s webcam and observe student status, the teacher can assess achievement accurately. Image processing technology can be applied in an assessment system in distance learning, student states can be observed and these observational results can be combined with behavior detection to help teachers assess student achievement in terms of teaching goals in the affective domain. This study had analyzed the theory and method of assessing affective domain teaching goals. The assessment system had been implemented and simulated using image processing technology and records to analyze student achievement of attending and responding stages with a class period, via fuzzy logic and a fuzzy integral. Simulation results indicate that this assessment system can accurately assess student achievement in terms of attending and responding stages of affective domain teaching goals.","2012","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","2501 - 2508","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fuzzy computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on the improvement of e-learning services on Moodle with limited system resources. The course design and Moodle management were improved as follows after some workarounds: (1) The “Final Test,” which is a JavaScript-based test inside the Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) content was divided into a Moodle quiz module. “Conditional Activities” were then adopted to allow users to take the “Final Test” after the completion of the {SCORM} content. (2) The course was reset annually to delete all {SCORM} tracking data. In this study, we obtain effective operational findings for developing robust e-learning services, particularly for Moodle. As a result, we can provided robust e-learning services in Japan because GakuNinMoodle and the security awareness education course for federated institute, “Learn with Princess Rin Rin: Cyberethics” are accessed by 102 institutes including Kyoto University, Gunma University, and National Institute of Technology through actual operations. In general, database optimization is the best method for improving {LMS} performance with limited system resources. Specifically, online courses that include {SCORM} content should be considered as an overhead of {API} calls between {LMS} and {SCORM} content to determine a temporary solution under the constraint of limited resources to improve the performance of {LMS} when numerous accesses and downloads of learning reports are requested. Therefore, robust e-learning services with Moodle can be obtained even with limited resources. Additional research is being conducted to analyze learning records and system logs to improve the contents according to the assumption that the best method to improve e-learning is by considering learner's behavior.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-21 13:14:41","","1710 - 1719","","","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-learning; Moodle; security awareness education; service robustness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moodle is currently the leading virtual learning environment in Spain, and a lot of different plugins have appeared to complement the lack of native tools to track the learning process in all its aspects. However, none of these take the temporal dimension as a possible behavior measurement into consideration. In this case study, a new technical and statistical approach to time tracking of students in Moodle will be discussed, so that time as a behavioral aspect can be considered in further assessments. Furthermore, this approach could not only be applied to Moodle, but to all other online virtual learning environments.","2014-06-18","2018-02-21 12:20:31","2018-02-21 12:20:31","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","access; assessment; behavior measurement; behaviour; computer aided instruction; Context; Data collection; Data mining; Education; e-learning; evaluation; Google; Google Analytics; Graphics; learning analytics; learning process tracking; Least squares approximations; moodle; Moodle; object-oriented methods; online education; online virtual learning environments; Spain; statistical analysis; statistical approach; student behavior tracking; student performance tracking; student time tracking; technical approach; temporal dimension; time; time behavior measurement; Web sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 9th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these learning activities collaboration often plays an important role. Usually, groups of students have to perform different tasks with single mobile device. This paper studies the effects of sharing a mobile device within groups and the size of groups in students’ engagement and their activity performance in an indoor location-based learning activity. In particular, the paper focuses on a game designed by a secondary education teacher to support a learning activity in a contemporary art museum. The teacher’s design has been implemented using “QuesTInSitu: The Game” technology. A total of 76 students played the game during a 3-h activity in the museum. The analysis of the data shows that while there are not important differences in the satisfaction with the activity of the students carrying and not carrying the mobile device within their groups, carrying the device does have a significant (positive) impact in their performance. Group size (4 vs. 5 members) does not seem to be a variable affecting individuals’ performance but students in 4-member groups express higher levels of engagement.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","377 - 385","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","secondary education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample in this study is 400 Middle Eastern tourists, and 10 government staff. The research tools used were questionnaires and interviews. The study found that the Middle Eastern tourists have high needs in health tourism which are as follows: 1) fair prices 2) embedding intensity 3) aromatherapy {IP} terminals 4) souvenirs for home, and 5) public transportation. Following the average analysis (t-test), it revealed that these aspects have a statistical difference of 0.05 between the sexes with regard to health tourism. Moreover, seven aspects that have a significant statistical difference at 0.05 were age, education, income, occupation, status, experience and nationality with regards to health tourism. According to the study, indicators which were claimed to assist in managing health tourism include; 1) variety of activities 2) Islam friendly accommodation 3) public transport 4) promotion of health tourism 5) access to prayer rooms 6) access to health tourism information, and 7) fair price of souvenirs. Furthermore, guidelines on health tourism management for Middle Eastern tourists in Phuket Province include; 1) Tourism Authority of Thailand and travel agency should be given more variety, especially the health based activities. 2) Sub-district administrative organization should have measures in place that harmonize with the Middle Eastern tourists’ needs. 3) Tourism Authority of Thailand should be studied in order to persuade Middle Eastern tourists to buy more souvenirs from the tourist attractions. 4) Thailand Government should be supported in arranging accommodation to be in line with Islamic principles. 5) Sub-district administrative organization have to arranged places for Middle Eastern tourists to praying particularly for ladies. 6) Thailand Government should inform the tourists from the Middle Eastern countries about activities involved in health tourism in Phuket. 7) Sub-district administrative organization should be executed in order to make all tourists feel safe, and also to protect them from being taken advantage of with regards to hiked prices.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","1146 - 1153","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Middle East Tourists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, we adopted two perspectives, (a) an individual motivational perspective derived from uses and gratifications approach and (b) a societal contextual approach from social stratification, conceptualizing health privacy as capital with multifaceted sociotechnical assets. Health privacy capital was analyzed relative to demographic, social-contextual, and medical condition variables, using the 2014 Health Information National Trends (HINTS) Survey (n = 3212). Findings confirmed three key facets of health privacy capital—awareness of privacy, attitude toward the importance of privacy and data sharing, and confidence in the ability to maintain privacy—and multivariate regression analyses showed positive relationships between privacy capital and engagement as well as outcomes related to health-related digital technology. On the other hand, our analysis found that the development of health privacy capital is susceptible to sociodemographic disparities. For instance, a higher level of education was related to all three dimensions of health privacy capital. Interactions between education and health privacy confidence were also significant in both dimensions of health outcomes, indicating that the positive impact of health privacy confidence is moderated by the lower level of education. Practical implications for patients and healthcare professionals are discussed.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","227 - 236","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social stratification and disparity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interactivity in hypermedia environments challenges learners to autonomously navigate such environments. Particularly in multiperspective hypermedia environments (MHEs), which emphasize the multiperspectivity of a topic, it is important to apply navigational behaviors that take advantage of this information structure through which different perspectives can be selected and compared. However, we argue that and test whether the availability of sufficient spatial working memory (WM) resources is an important precondition for effectively engaging in this type of perspective processing. Specifically, we examined N = 97 German fourth-graders' navigational behaviors (i.e., perspective processing, content processing, and irrelevant processing) during hypermedia learning and their relation to spatial {WM} and performance. To this end, we developed an {MHE} on the biodiversity of 24 fish species. Participants’ navigational behavior was determined via log file analyses, while their performance was assessed by exploration questions and inferential questions (about fish) and by scientific transfer questions (about the biodiversity of another species). Our results indicated that spatial {WM} was positively related to perspective processing, which was positively related to performance. Mediation analyses revealed that perspective processing partially explained the relation between spatial {WM} and performance. Thus, both spatial {WM} and perspective processing are important for benefitting from MHEs.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","145 - 158","","","55, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Elementary school children","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

T-tests and {ANOVA} revealed that work engagement significantly differed with age, education level, and experience. There was no difference in Work engagement as far as gender, marital status, tenure, and income was concerned. Pearson Correlations revealed significant relationships of work engagement with age, education level and experience. However, when regression was done to find out the determinants of WE, gender and education came out to be the predictor variables. The study has managerial implications as employers now know that work engagement is predicted by higher education and that males are more engaged than females in the {IT} industry.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","146 - 153","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate these topics, this observational study tracks and records the progressive refinements of four authentic architectural design projects of students, during an academic course. Findings of this study show that (1) the analytic experimentation of the simulation enables the students to iterate the goals relevant to the physical properties of design solutions responding to the behavioral performances of heterogeneous users, (2) the observable representation of dynamic users' behaviors inspires them to iterate the goals that reflect the psychological and social implications of solutions, (3) the simulation enables students to iterate potential solutions at different scales, ranging from masterplans, to prototypes, to design details, (4) in the final stage of iterating design solutions, the students iterated the parameters of Virtual Users to examine the full-performances of a final solution under what-if scenarios related to human behavior aspects (5) the students learn in the process of modeling detailed activities, and observing unexpected behavior outcomes during the simulation, experimenting the relationship between the properties of users and design solutions, beyond what they presumed. The evidence-based approach of this study reveals the applicability of human behavior simulation for the students' iteration and in-depth learning in the search for an optimal match between built environments and human activities in architectural design.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","1 - 11","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Architectural design projects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Problem solving is considered an essential cognitive activity wherein people are required to understand a problem, apply their knowledge, and monitor behavior to solve the issue. Problem solving has recently gained attention in education research, as it is considered an essential ability for effective learning. This study aims to investigate the relationship between learning styles and learning performance. To provide adaptive suggestions for optimizing problem-solving abilities, developed a hybrid learning style identification (HLSI) mechanism based on a k-means clustering algorithm was developed. The participants were 67 undergraduate students. The experiment demonstrated that {HLSI} can successfully cluster learning styles into three or four combinations based on learning performance, which suggests that the data mining technique can successfully explore multiple learning styles in problem-solving abilities. Additionally, 13 teachers were included in the study to discuss the effectiveness of the {HLSI} mechanism, and the results indicated a 95% probability of obtaining an above-average acceptance of the proposed system.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","552 - 561","","","55, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","teaching/learning strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When something good happens in one's life, an update may be posted. Conversely, when something isn't going right, a status update to that effect may also be posted. For those of us that use Facebook, we see this every day and may in fact be contributing to it. Nonetheless, the regular sharing of personal information also poses both a security and privacy risk. Thus, it is important that we understand the extent to which people post various types of information on social networking sites, such as Facebook. In this study, we develop an instrument to measure two types of status updates on Facebook: those that are positive in content and those that are negative. We then use this instrument, in conjunction with instruments that measure personality and trait affect, to determine to what extent various psychological factors may help explain the degree and nature of posting status updates on Facebook. This was done by performing two statistical analysis techniques: Pearson correlations and the use of partial-least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Overall, 14 out of 16 hypotheses were supported in at least one of the two statistical analysis techniques.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","132 - 140","","","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Security and privacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new algorithm is of considerable interest in communications where the desired signal is weak compared with the interfering signals or where the desired signal can be easily separated out. With the proposed algorithm, the nulls of the array system are repetitively updated one by one in a cyclical manner through a sequence of adjustment cycles. In each adjustment cycle, a particular null is updated by using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and the update of each particular null will not affect other null positions. The proposed method is very effective and useful in the sense that it will result in a nearly flat gain in the antenna pattern, except zero gains at the null directions. Moreover, as will be demonstrated later from both analysis and simulation results, the convergence behavior of the new algorithm is significantly faster than the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) method and is almost independent of the external noise environment.","2012-09","2018-02-21 12:52:42","2018-02-21 12:52:42","","2116-2125","","9","92","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive antenna arrays; Array signal processing; IIR array processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seen-function is a chat-feature that provides more transparency over the course of a chat conversation and thus may also intensify the mutual awareness of chat partners. Based on the need to belong and fear of ostracism as motivators for user behavior it was hypothesized that users with a higher value of these personality traits would have a higher expectation for others to answer immediately and a higher perceived obligation to answer immediately. Indeed, fear of ostracism and need to belong were positively related to perceived obligations to answer and expectations toward chat partners. However, the perceived obligation to answer immediately was higher than the average expectation toward others to do so. Looking for different clusters of users, we found three groups of users in the data set that differ in terms of their expectations and perceived obligations.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","296 - 302","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chat norms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Netherlands over 40% of reported sick leave is due to back problems, mainly caused by carrying out heavy work. The goal of the iLift project was to develop a game for nursing personnel to train them in lifting and transfer techniques. The main focus was not on testing for the effectiveness of the game itself, but rather on the design of the game as an autogenous trigger and its place in a behavioral change support system. In this article, the design and development of such a health behavior change support system is addressed, describing cycles of design and evaluation. Methods (a) To define the problem space, use context and user context, focus group interviews were conducted with Occupational Therapists (n = 4), Nurses (n = 10) and Caregivers (n = 12) and a thematic analysis was performed. We interviewed experts (n = 5) on the subject of lifting and transferring techniques. (b) A design science research approach resulted in a playable prototype. An expert panel conducted analysis of video-recorded playing activities. (c) Field experiment: We performed a dynamic analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of the prototype through biometric data from player sessions (n = 620) by healthcare professionals (n = 37). Results (a) Occupational Therapists, Nurses and Caregivers did not recognise a lack of knowledge with training in lifting and transferring techniques. All groups considered their workload, time pressure and a culturally determined habit to place the patient's well being above their own as the main reason not to apply appropriate lifting and transferring techniques. This led to a shift in focus from a serious game teaching lifting and transferring techniques to a health behavior change support system containing a game with the intention to influence behavior. (b) Building and testing (subcomponents of) the prototype resulted in design choices regarding players perspective, auditory and visual feedback, overall playability and perceived immersiveness. This design process also addressed the behavior shaping capacities of the game and its place within the health behavior change support system. An expert panel on lifting and transferring techniques validated the provoked in-game activities as being authentic. (c) Regression analysis showed an increase of the game score and dashboard score when more sessions were played, indicating an in-game training effect. A post-hoc test revealed that from an average of 10 playing sessions or more, the dashboard score and the game score align, which indicates behavioral change towards executing appropriate static lifting and transferring techniques. Conclusions Data gathered in the final field test shows an in-game training effect, causing players to exhibit correct techniques for static lifting and transferring techniques but also revealed the necessity for future social system development and especially regarding intervention acceptance. Social system factors showed a strong impact on the games persuasive capacities and its autogenous intent.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:33","2018-02-06 16:57:33","","11 - 23","","","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lifting and transfer techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since these decisions may seriously affect the students’ future life, it is necessary to pay precise attention to the decision-making process. However, many causes like lack of mental readiness, impact of irrelevant factors, change in views and limitation in concentration power of the commission members plus some other undistinguishable facts can affect the decision process leading to many ruinous problems. The paper aims simulation of a decision-making process which is used by management or consulting teams in order to solve this usual problem. As an especial case study, it focuses on the decisions made by members of university commissions on an especial sort of students’ requests, who have faced problems with their education. After analyzing the decision process, we have designed a hybrid expert system that can regenerate the process. In this system, the criteria shape a fuzzy rule base with linguistic variables and the membership functions are adjusted by experts through interviews and/or questionnaire. Indeed, it is a composition of a fuzzy {MCDM} and a fuzzy inference system (FIS). Moreover, to differentiate between the criteria, we have attributed weightings to the criteria, which are computed using a fuzzy {AHP} method. Results show that the system output error in comparison to the historical data is less than 5%, and it can resemble the council’s behavior. This supporting system can be applied to generate consistent outputs that contribute in convergence and unification of the decisions, and hence preventing false aftermaths.","2012","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","3682 - 3691","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Students Especial Cases Council","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research includes qualitative data collected from teacher observations and interviews, as well as a detailed analysis of the student participants’ reading and comprehension scores on tests. The researcher and teachers engaged in systematic (weekly) review and analysis of their perceptions of student progress based on both the reading and comprehension data and observations, and then made mid-course corrections in the technology approaches used in the reading intervention program. Results indicate that this assistive technology intervention, guided by teacher-researcher collaboration and reflection, yielded both student and teacher gains. This study attempts to address gaps in the literature, demonstrating that assistive technologies, introduced in a timely way and implemented with support, can provide measurable gains in reading fluency, comprehension, and engagement.

Organizations are, in fact, allocating time, effort, skills, human resources and technology and this raises the constant need to measure the {ROI} and legitimize the use of social media in the context of organizational development. However, how can organizations attempt to measure the efficiency and return on investments on a social media content approach that has not been strategically designed? In this paper, we report on previous research which we have further developed into a more comprehensive and solid analysis of types of social media content strategies that are being implemented in the Higher Education Sector, using clustering to group analogue content strategies and social media {KPI} to measure the efficiency of each of the main i. This work is based on a previously proposed editorial model for the design of social media content strategies for Higher Education Institutions, and results show which are the most relevant strategic areas of communication and corresponding return, in terms of publics’ engagement, that organizations can obtain.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","826 - 834","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KPI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the development of these {ML} models rely on a unique training set and learning stops once this set has been processed. Training these classifiers requires a representative amount of data, but the gathering, preprocess, and validation of samples is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, for a classical, non-incremental approach to ML, it is necessary to wait long enough to collect all the required data. In contrast, an incremental learning approach may allow us to build an initial classifier with a smaller number of samples and update it incrementally when new data are collected. In this study, an incremental learning algorithm for Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (iGDA) based on the Graybill and Deal weighted combination of estimators is introduced. Each time a new set of data becomes available, a new estimation is carried out and a combination with a previous estimation is performed. iGDA does not require access to the previously used data and is able to include new classes that were not in the original analysis, thus allowing the customization of the models to the distribution of data at a particular clinical center. An evaluation using five benchmark databases has been used to evaluate the behaviour of the iGDA algorithm in terms of stability–plasticity, class inclusion and order effect. Finally, the iGDA algorithm has been applied to automatic brain tumour classification with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and compared with two state-of-the-art incremental algorithms. The empirical results obtained show the ability of the algorithm to learn in an incremental fashion, improving the performance of the models when new information is available, and converging in the course of time. Furthermore, the algorithm shows a negligible instance and concept order effect, avoiding the bias that such effects could introduce.","2011","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","677 - 687","","4","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Magnetic resonance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a scoping review process, over 150 resources were consulted to organize 6 domains of motivation and threat to collaboration in KPTs: Resource Acquisition, Advancing Science, Building Relationships, Knowledge Transfer, Recognition and Reward, and Maintenance of Beliefs. Findings show how domains vary in their presentation of depth and diversity of motivation and threat indicators as well as their relationship with each other within and across domains. The findings of 51 indicators resulting from the review provide a psychosocial framework for which to establish a hierarchy of collaborative reasoning for individual engagement in {KPTs} thus allowing for further research into the mechanism of collaborative engagement. The indicators serve as a preliminary step in establishing a protocol for testing of the psychometric properties of intrapersonal measures of collaboration readiness.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","e00105","","5","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary, lower secondary and high school teachers can have a significant impact on the e-safety of children and youngsters by raising their awareness of the risks associated with the use of technologies. Technical e-safety has roughly been acknowledged as an area where interpersonal relationships are not prioritised. A qualitative analysis of open-coded in-depth interviews with {ICT} teachers using the Grounded Theory method identified determinants that influence teachers’ knowledge and routines and a model of formation was developed. Firstly, there are external and internal influences. Another factor is teachers’ attitudes to e-safety rules that should support safe behaviour. Thirdly, teachers have barriers to protection in their minds and these could hinder their safe behaviour. Previous negative experiences have also been identified as another significant factor that affects a teacher’s e-safety habits. The developed theory describes causal and intervening relationships between the given categories. The developed theory will serve as a basis for proposing steps to improve {ICT} teachers’ knowledge of e-safety and ways teacher education might be adapted to achieve that.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:05","2018-02-06 16:57:05","","1488 - 1502","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study administered an existing three-factor scale to three samples. The factor structure was not confirmed among high school teachers (n: 33), high school students (n: 479) and undergraduates (n: 86). A new and more comprehensive scale to address contemporary cyberloafing behaviors during lectures was developed through literature review, expert panels and observations. Data from undergraduate students (n: 471) were used for construct validation with an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which revealed a five-factor structure and explained 70.44% of the total variance. Factors were sharing, shopping, real-time updating, accessing online content and gaming/gambling. The scale was administered to another undergraduate student sample (n: 215) and a social networker student group (n: 515).

A direct qualification and quantification of the chemical surface composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and a determination of the surface topography by atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted in the course of the {ALD} cycles without vacuum break. {XPS} revealed a substrate-inhibited Ru growth on a hydrogen-terminated silicon surface, which was preceded by an incubation period of 20 {ALD} cycles. The Si surface oxidized during the first 50 cycles. {AFM} measurements showed a roughness maximum around the 40th {ALD} cycle, which suggested an island growth mode and thus corresponded with the substrate inhibition. As verified from the {AFM} data with an analytical model by Nilsen et al. the Ru islands coalesced between the 40th and 50th {ALD} cycle. The {ALD} growth initiation of Ru was also investigated on aluminum oxide and tantalum nitride. {XPS} revealed a similarly inhibited growth behavior on all the investigated substrates. However, the {ECPR} adsorption during the very first Ru precursor pulse differed as the amount of chemisorbed Ru on the NHy-terminated TaNx(O, C) surface was much higher compared to the OH-terminated Al2O3 and the H-terminated Si surface. Summarizing, we demonstrated that in-vacuo {XPS} and {AFM} as well as the combination of both are ideally suited for studying the {ALD} growth initiation of Ru. Furthermore, we provided important chemical information about the initial Ru precursor adsorption on several foreign substrate materials, which will direct further investigations towards a non-inhibited Ru growth.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","151 - 155","","","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ECPR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the studies, the advantages and limitations of role-playing simulation games deserve further exploration. However, existing analyses of the behavioral patterns of role-playing simulation games in science education remain substantially lacking, particularly the integration of diverse behavioral pattern analysis methods. This study thus seeks to analyze the videotaped learning process of 86 college students in game-based learning activities that utilize a role-playing simulation game. This study used the integrated method of sequential analysis and cluster analysis and explored the learners’ flow state and learning behavioral patterns. The results show that the use of integrated behavioral pattern analysis helps to explore the traits and limitations of role-playing simulation games in science education as well as learners’ reflective behavior patterns. This study identifies a wide variety of learning behavior patterns from three potential clusters of learners and then discusses the learning process of each cluster. The different levels of flow experienced by the learners affected their learning behavior patterns; learners with higher levels of flow demonstrated a more in-depth reflective process. The study further discusses the results of these analyses and makes relevant recommendations for the systems development of the games, its educational applications, and evaluation methods.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-06 16:58:06","","424 - 435","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","learning process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present an interactive 3D physics engine with a wide variety of applications. In common with traditional FEM, the use of a local element stiffness matrix is retained. However, unlike typical non-linear {FEM} routines elements forces, moments and inertia are appropriately lumped at nodes following the dynamic relaxation method. A semi-implicit time integration scheme updates linear and angular momentum, and subsequently the local coordinate frames of the nodes. A co-rotational approach is used to compute the resultant field of displacements in global coordinates including the effect of large deformations. The results obtained compare well against established commercial software. We demonstrate that the method presented allows the making of interactive structural models that can be used in teaching to develop an intuitive understanding of structural behaviour. We also show that the same interactive physics framework allows real-time optimization that can be used for geometric and structural design applications.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","32 - 41","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dynamic relaxation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internet and Social Media can be used to promote a prudent use of antibiotics. Objective To establish the extent of Internet and Social Media use to search for antibiotic related information and the potential implications in health care among adult population in Italy. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2017, among a sample of parents of public school students. A 2-stage cluster sample design was planned. An informed consent form and a questionnaire were given to selected students to deliver to their parents. The questionnaire included questions on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward antibiotic use, and questions about Internet use to gather information about antibiotics. Results A total of 913 parents completed the questionnaire, with a 67.4% response rate; 22.1% did not know when it was appropriate to use antibiotics. 32.3% of parents reported self-medication with antibiotics. 73.4% of respondents used the Internet to search for information about antibiotic use. Among social networks users, 46.5% reported the use of these media to get information about antibiotics and 45% of instant messaging app users share information about antibiotics. The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Internet use to search for antibiotic-related information was higher among females, younger subjects, with a higher level of education, in those who reported self-medication with antibiotics and in those who needed additional information on side effects of antibiotics from the {GP} compared with those who did not need any additional information. Internet use was significantly less likely in participants with cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared with those without chronic conditions, and in those who reported to strongly agree/agree, or were uncertain about antibiotic use without a {GP} prescription, compared with those who reported to be disagree/strongly disagree. Conclusions Internet and social media are widely used for antibiotic-related information seeking in the Italian population. Health organizations must consider social media within their communication strategy to promote the appropriate Web use for antibiotic-related information seeking in the general population, although more evidence is needed regarding the optimal mix of communication interventions.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","131 - 139","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We extend the concept of streamlines to interactive three dimensional representations of the coupled vector fields generated during marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys. These vector fields have measurable amplitudes throughout many hundreds of cubic kilometres. Electromagnetic streamline representation makes electromagnetic interactions within complex geo-electrical setting comprehensible. We develop an interface to rapidly compute and interactively visualise the electric and magnetic fields as streamlines for 3D marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys. Several examples highlighting how interactive use has value in marine controlled source electromagnetic survey design, interpretation and teaching are provided. The first videos of electric, magnetic and Poynting vector field streamlines are provided along with the first published example of the airwave represented as streamlines. We demonstrate that the electric field airwave is a circulating vortex moving down and out from the air–water interface towards the ocean floor. The use of interactive streamlines is not limited to marine controlled source electromagnetic methods. Streamlines provides a high level visualisation tool for interpreting the electric and magnetic field behaviour generated by a wide range of electromagnetic survey configurations for complex 3D geo-electrical settings.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","1 - 10","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrocarbon Exploration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to answer the questions, a longitudinal case study was conducted in unicultural and multicultural teams. We have taken survey for 144 participants over three stages, as well as interviewed 64 participants. Results of the analysis of the survey data firstly show that no significant difference exists between multicultural and unicultural groups. Then, two factors, collaboration process and clear task help explain this phenomenon. However, the trust development of multicultural groups shows instability and keeps decreasing over time, while unicultural groups behave differently. We found that language, values and habitual behavior lead to the differences in these two types of groups.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:59","2018-02-06 16:57:59","","267 - 276","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research on these programs has focused primarily on how students’ incoming demographics and prior academic performance predict academic performance at the university level. This study investigated changes in students’ academic motivation orientations over the course of one bridge program, and how a learning analytics-based intervention was employed by academic advisors to inform their face-to-face meetings with students. The results of our study show that students’ mastery orientation decreased over the course of the bridge program, and indicate that students’ exposure to displays of their academic performance negatively predicts this change. The findings suggest that student perceptions of their goals and formative performance need to be carefully considered in the design of learning analytics interventions since the resulting tools can affect students’ interpretations of their own data as well as their subsequent academic success.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:32","2018-02-21 13:55:54","","90 - 97","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","At-risk students; design-based research; Design-based research; Early warning systems; Learning analytics; Motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of Self-Efficacy, Subjective Norm, Enjoyment, Computer Anxiety and Experience on students’ Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) of an e-portfolio system and their Behavioural Intention (BI) to use the system for learning. To do this, the study tested and used the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-Learning (GETAMEL) in the context of e-portfolios. Valid data were collected from 242 {UK} undergraduate students who had been introduced to e-portfolios. The data set was analysed using {SPSS} software. Results showed that the best predictor of student’s Perceived Ease of Use of the e-portfolio is Experience, followed by Enjoyment, Self-Efficacy and Subjective Norm. The best predictor of student’s Perceived Usefulness of the e-portfolio is Perceived Ease of Use followed by Enjoyment. Both Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness predict student’s Behavioural Intention to Use the e-portfolio. The findings improve understanding regarding acceptance of e-portfolio systems and this work is therefore of particular interest to researchers, developers and practitioners of e-portfolios.","2016","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","75 - 90","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been proposed that tools fostering more direct social interaction and feedback amongst learners and teachers would foster higher levels of engagement. If so, one would expect that the richer the tools used, the higher the levels of learner engagement. However, the actual use of tools and contributions to interactions in the learning situation may relate to students’ motivation. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between available tools used, student motivation, participation, and performance on a final exam in an online course in economics (N = 110). In line with our assumptions, we found some support for the expected association between autonomous motivation and participation in web-videoconferences as well as between autonomous motivation and the grade on the final exam. Students’ tool use and participation were significantly correlated with each other and with exam scores, but participation appeared to be a stronger predictor of the final exam score than tool use. This study adds to the knowledge base needed to develop guidelines on how synchronous communication in e-learning can be used.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","285 - 292","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measuring student attention is an essential part of educational assessment. As new learning styles develop, new tools and assessment methods are also needed. The focus of this paper is to develop IoT-based interaction framework and analysis of the student experience of electronic learning (eLearning). The learning behaviors of students attending remote video lectures are assessed by logging their behavior and analyzing the resulting multimedia data using machine learning algorithms. An attention-scoring algorithm, its workflow, and the mathematical formulation for the smart assessment of the student learning experience are established. This setup has a data collection module, which can be reproduced by implementing the algorithm in any modern programming language. Some faces, eyes, and status of eyes are extracted from video stream taken from a webcam using this module. The extracted information is saved in a dataset for further analysis. The analysis of the dataset produces interesting results for student learning assessments. Modern learning management systems can integrate the developed tool to take student learning behaviors into account when assessing electronic learning strategies.","2018","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-21 13:15:03","","909 - 919","","","79, Part 3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Interaction in eLearning; Internet of Things (IoT); IoT interoperable services; Learning behavior; Learning management system (LMS); Visual attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was carried out with students who joined Facebook learning community that was created for the Computing I course which was taught with blended learning method. Data were collected from 316 university students by utilizing three self-report instruments: {KSB} scale, {ASE} scale (sub-scales: ‘social status’, ‘cognitive applications’ and ‘technical skills’) and classroom community (CC) scale (sub-scales: ‘connectedness’ and ‘learning’). The path analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) further verified that students’ {KSB} were related to their {ASE} and SoC in e-learning community. The results of the study revealed that the {ASE} and SoC of the students positively affect their KSB. And in terms of sub-scales, the connectedness to the community, learning perception in the community, the self-efficacy of the students on the cognitive applications in the courses and their social status in the community positively affect KSB. However, students’ self-efficacy perceptions on their technical skills affect {KSB} positively but its affect size was smaller compared to other sub-scales. Further research studies and implications are presented and discussed.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-06 16:58:11","","373 - 382","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sense of community","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These obstacles could be overcome by information technology tools and the Internet. Patient health records, shared with the caregiver, encourage behaviour necessary to effectively manage diabetes (improvement of therapeutic compliance through motivational support). These web-based programs enable access to patient medical records, downloadable capillary glycaemia data, blood glucose diary information, a secure messaging system, manual or automatic feedback on blood glucose data, educational websites and also online diaries (e.g. exercise, diet and medication). TeleDiab-3 assessed such a web-based platform for the telemonitoring of diabetes in a population of 700 type 1 diabetic patients. Additionally, TeleDiab-1 conducted in 180 type 1 diabetic patients demonstrated the relevance of smartphone software (Diabeo) that enables the patient to obtain real-time decision support on insulin dose, provides an electronic blood glucose diary that communicates via the Internet with the doctor, and also enables telephone consultations. TeleSage, which aims to secure institutional recognition of Diabeo, will test a similar technology, and a telemedicine delivery platform involving both doctors and nurse educators. Other examples (retinopathy, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diabetic foot) are presented in this review. The conditions for success are also analysed. Barriers to the deployment of telemedicine are numerous: patient and caregivers’ willingness to adhere to the technology, ergonomics and integration of electronic medical records, and caregivers’ remuneration. Ongoing studies should support and recognise the therapeutic value of telemedicine in diabetology.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","23 - 28","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","telemedicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is still difficult to measure and assess each student's engagement in learning groups. Moreover, how to promote students' engagement in learning groups is also an important problem. Learning analytics in {IT} environment helps us understand the whole process of students' learning in groups, analyze these problems in collaborative learning and find ways to improve group learning effect. We examined the role of Slack in students' engagement in collaborative learning. Specifically, whether the openness and visibility of each group member's contribution on Slack can promote students' engagement. Based on the benefits and loss of engagement, we proposed the research model and hypotheses. Surveys (n = 181) were issued online to postgraduate students at different times of a course in China. Data was analysed by SmartPLS. Results show that mutual trust, social influence and reward valence among students can promote their teamwork engagement. Furthermore, teamwork engagement can prompt students' learning and work satisfaction. However, the moderation role of task complexity between teamwork engagement and personal success (i.e. learning and work satisfaction) is not supported. Theoretical contribution and implications for educational practices are discussed. Research limitations and future research directions are also presented.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:40","2018-02-21 13:56:05","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collaborative learning; Learning analytics; Slack; Social influence; Student engagement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, this topic has been included in Computer Science curriculum, but students present difficulties to design {MPI} parallel applications efficiently. We present a novel methodology for teaching parallel programming centered on improving parallel applications written by students through their experiences obtained during classes. The methodology integrates theoretical and practical sections which are focused on teaching two parallel paradigms, master/Worker and SPMD. These paradigms were selected due to their different communication and computation behaviors, which generate challenges for students when they wish to improve performance application metrics. Our methodology allows students to discover their own errors and how to correct them. In addition, students analyze the issues and advantages in the application designed in order to enhance the performance metrics. Applying this methodology gave us a significant progress in parallel applications designed by students, where we have observed an improvement of around 47% in the students’ skill about parallel programming when they design parallel applications.","2010","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","875 - 883","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Performance metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper was designed to research about the different factors and drivers that could influence students’ behaviour into the usage of mobile technologies for learning. The methodology was based on a quantitative survey grounded on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Data were collected from medical students in University of Coimbra. This model pointed to a behaviour pattern based on the experience and application by medical students, correlating with a strong attitude towards using mobile technology for learning (57%) and willingness to recommend it (40.5%). In line with previous studies, Social Influence raised to be an important factor towards the Attitude and Behavioural Intention of using Mobile Learning. In addition, according to the results, the student’s ease of perception seems to be the main factor affecting the Social Influence (31.9%) and the reliability for recommending this technology for learning was the main factor that affected the Behavioural Intention. Findings provide support for Technology Acceptance Model and the implications of these findings are discussed within the context of Innovation in Education.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:53","2018-02-06 16:57:53","","612 - 620","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is especially placed on the ability of methods of fuzzy natural logic to provide information in sentences of natural language. Our approach is based on the decomposition of time series into three components: the trend-cycle, seasonal component and noise. The trend-cycle is extracted using the F-transform, and its course is characterized by automatically generated linguistic description. The latter is then used to forecast the trend-cycle. The trend-cycle can be, furthermore, decomposed into trend (general tendency) and cycle. The former is computed again using the F-transform. Moreover, the F1-transform makes it possible to estimate the direction of the trend, which can then be characterized by expressions of natural language (stagnating, slightly increasing, sharply decreasing, etc.). Finally, we focus on selected problems of mining information from time series. First, we suggest an algorithm for finding intervals of monotonous behavior and then show how the theory of intermediate quantifiers (a constituent of fuzzy natural logic) and generalized Aristotle's syllogisms can be applied to automatic summarization of information on time series.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","52 - 72","","","285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intermediate quantifiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PubMed/MEDLINE offers an alternative to free-text searching on the web, allowing searchers to do a keyword-based search using Medical Subject Headings. However, finding relevant information within a limited time frame remains a difficult task. The current study is based on an error analysis of data from a retrieval experiment conducted at the nursing departments of two Belgian universities and a British university. We identified the main difficulties in query formulation and relevance judgment and compared the profiles of the best and worst performers in the test. For the analysis, a query collection was built from the queries submitted by our test participants. The queries in this collection are all aimed at finding the same specific information in PubMed, which allowed us to identify what exactly went wrong in the query formulation step. Another crucial aspect for efficient information retrieval is relevance judgment. Differences between potential and actual recall of each query offered indications of the extent to which participants overlooked relevant citations. The test participants were divided into “worst”, “average” and “best” performers based on the number of relevant citations they selected: zero, one or two and three or more, respectively. We tried to find out what the differences in background and in search behavior were between these three groups.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","4106 - 4114","","10","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","information seeking behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper indicates that there may be a risk in doing this as TM-21 only relies on the behavior of the average LED degradation, instead of taking into account the degradation of all individual LEDs. Therefore, we propose a more profound statistical analysis in order to make the appropriate step from TM-21 extrapolation to lumen maintenance on a product level. This is needed as some commercial claims are based on 10 years of warranty and some service bids provide periods of 20 to 25 years of operation. This paper reviews the different approaches currently available to perform lumen maintenance extrapolations. We propose a new method to analyze and extrapolate LM-80 data using a more profound statistical approach.","2016-07","2018-02-21 12:52:46","2018-02-21 12:52:46","","39-44","","","62","","Microelectronics Reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Degradation; LEDs; Lifetime; Lumen decay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Obviously, such differences are reflected in the training humans provide to machine learning algorithms that in turn affects the induced models. A coherent set of experiment design and analysis methods is presented which was applied for studying gender differences in visual inspection decision making. Detailed results from a study with 50 female and 50 male subjects are reported. Although immediate performance measures were almost equal, highly significant differences in the structure of induced decision trees have been found (p = 0.00005). This demonstrates the value of our contribution for researchers intending to investigate the otherwise hidden structure of cognitive gender differences rather than their merits.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","62 - 76","","","224","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Experiment design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using advanced Factor Analysis methods on the self-reported privacy behaviors and feature awareness of 308 Facebook users, we extrapolate six distinct privacy management strategies, including: Privacy Maximizers, Selective Sharers, Privacy Balancers, Self-Censors, Time Savers/Consumers, and Privacy Minimalists and six classes of privacy proficiency based on feature awareness, ranging from Novices to Experts.

Beyond the use of Making to teach specific {STEM} concepts as is common in prior work, we propose that Making activities should be designed with the focus of instilling a Maker mindset in children. Our target is elementary-school-level children aged 8 to 11. We present an approach that conceptualizes Making as a ‘Means-to-an-Ends’ to nurture a Maker mindset and identity in children. The approach was embodied in a carefully-designed storytelling Making kit called the Maker Theater, and two Maker workshops for children in the target age range. Our analysis goal in this article was to investigate how the potential for a Maker mindset/identity formation may be manifested in children’s attitudes and behaviors. Guided by a theoretical framework of three key determinants of the Maker mindset (self-efficacy, motivation and interest), we analyzed workshop data using qualitative coding methods to derive thematic indicators. We discuss our contributions and the value of our findings for the child–computer interaction community.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:33","2018-02-06 16:58:33","","11 - 19","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Self-identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social networks may form the primary means by which environmental influences determine individual traits. Several studies have shown the influence of social networks on decision-making, behaviors and wellbeing. Smartphones have great potential for measuring social networks in a real world setting. Here we tested the feasibility of using people's own smartphones as a data collection platform for face-to-face interactions. We developed an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data and acquired one week of data from 14 participants in our organization. The Bluetooth scanning statistics were used to quantify the time-resolved connection strength between participants and define the weights of a dynamic social network. We used network metrics to quantify changes in network topology over time and non-negative matrix factorization to identify cliques or subgroups that reoccurred during the week. The scanning rate varied considerably between smartphones running Android and iOS and egocentric networks metrics were correlated with the scanning rate. The time courses of two identified subgroups matched with two meetings that took place that week. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using participants' own smartphones to map social network, whilst identifying current limitations of using generic smartphones. The bias introduced by variations in scanning rate and missing data is an important limitation that needs to be addressed in future studies.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-06 16:59:09","","e00037","","3","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first stage they do statistical analysis of the data. In the second stage, students interpolate missing data and project component data to a 2D map of the metro area. In the third stage students create the mathematical models by carrying out curve fitting through least squares technique. In the third stage, students solve the models by finding roots, solving systems of equations, solving differential equations or integrating.

In order to do this, a version of the {NARS} and {RAS} questionnaires, adapted for children, was used. The analysis of the results of these questionnaires considers differences between age groups and students lectured by a robot vs. a human teacher.

Meaningful posts include discussion comments that reflect meaning-based engagement with the course material. Students with optimal patterns and types of discussion participation do better than those students who just follow a point system of quantity-based engagement. Students were given three behavioral assessments and then monitored for meaningful posts and successful online behavior using the tracking features within Blackboard. Results were analyzed using a multiple regression and showed that a significant percentage of online learning is predicted by meaningful posts and homework performance while total online activity does not uniquely predict learning outcomes. Students with more meaningful posts show more engagement with the online materials and better learning than those with less meaningful posts.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:11","2018-02-06 16:58:11","","2730 - 2732","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their closed-form mean square deviation (MSD) expressions for the transient and steady-state regimes are derived. Additionally, bounds on the step-size which guarantee mean square stability are given. It is found that the step-size bound and transient behavior of the LMS and the steady-state MSD of the NLMS depend on the kurtosis of the input signal. Convergence rates and steady-state MSDs of the two algorithms are then compared, which shows that the normalized variant with a large step-size would offer faster convergence rate than the LMS scheme. However, when small step-sizes are employed, the LMS achieves lower steady-state MSD than the NLMS at the same convergence rate.","2017-02","2018-02-21 12:52:33","2018-02-21 12:52:33","","20-26","","","131","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kurtosis; LMS; NLMS; Steady-state; Step-size bound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus our work on secondary education. The question is not to predict the performance of students, from the collected data, which is always controversial; or just define a set of pre-established metrics, obtained from the digital data contained into the VLE, and monitor them, indirectly inducing an assessment regime. The aim is to look beyond the traces left by students and to measure the motivation of a student in a particular task, of a given subject, and in a specific day. For this purpose, we rely on the psychometric theory of measurement to build a composite index of motivation and we embed it into a Learning Analytics system. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide teachers and stakeholders with objective and accurate (quasi) real time information about students’ motivation for learning, and hence adequately adapt and personalize the teaching methodologies and strategies in classrooms. The approach is general and can also be used in tertiary education for training students and researchers in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:46","2018-02-21 13:52:46","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","HPC professional training strategies; Learning Analytics; Measuring motivation; Principal Component Analysis; Training for Data Intensive Computing; Virtual Learning Environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical research in the workplace has been much less represented than in formal education. Even less research is available that aimed to identify which technological scaffolding interventions, out of those available in a learning environment, had the highest influence on specific micro-level process of self-regulated learning. This paper reports on the findings of a case study conducted in the naturalistic settings of two organizations in Europe (N = 53) for the period of two months. Trace data about the events of engagement with the technological scaffolding interventions and micro-level processes of self-regulated learning were collected. Both a transition graph based analysis of the temporal dependencies of the collected events and multiple linear regression analyses showed that an intervention that promoted social awareness had consistently the highest effect on all the micro-level processes used in the study. This intervention was followed by the intervention that offered system-generated recommendations about learning paths, learning activities and knowledge assets to stimulate engagement into the micro-level processes within the forethought or preparatory phase of self-regulated learning. These findings suggest that both the social and organizational contexts should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at supporting the forethought and engagement phases. Further discussion about research, methodological, and learning technology design implications is provided.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-21 13:56:28","","469 - 482","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Learning analytics; Learning scaffolding; Learning technology; learning technology; Micro-level processes; Self-regulated learning; Workplace learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-lasting events, such as calcium transients, are activated and required for the induction of LTD. Further, a positive-feedback kinase loop was shown to follow the transient events and to aid the transition between {LTD} induction and prolonged synaptic depression. Yet, it is not entirely clear as to how {LTD} is maintained and how the maintenance mechanisms are activated, mainly because of a lack of experimental studies regarding this topic, while an idea has been theoretically proposed. A new analysis of the experimental results suggests that early maintenance mechanisms display a threshold behavior and that they may be of stochastic nature. This suggestion is conceptually consistent with an idea from a computational study, which postulates that other bistable switch systems are required for {LTD} maintenance. We thus propose that cellular mechanisms showing a threshold behavior and a stochastic nature maintain LTD, and that future experimental studies in search of such mechanisms would be an important step toward fully understanding the time course of LTD.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","32 - 35","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stochastic nature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that habitual media multitasking correlates negatively with video-recorded lecture learning performance, with mind wandering mediating this association. Eighty-one participants from the National University of Singapore first completed a media multitasking survey (Loh &amp; Kanai, 2014; Ophir et al., 2009). They then studied Coursera video-recorded lectures, during which their mind wandering tendencies were assessed using direct probes. Finally, participants attempted a test relating to what they have studied. Four regression models were built to analyse the data, and revealed evidence that supported the present hypothesis, even after we controlled for phenomenological variables relating to learning (i.e., anxiety, mental fatigue, and prior subject knowledge).

Thus, in order to provide better academic achievement, more and more instructors are adapting collaborative learning to their classes. However, two major problems lurk behind collaborative learning. First, it is difficult to apply collaborative learning because students tend to engage passively with traditional lectures. As a result, interactive technologies such as clickers have been applied to increase interactive learning and raise the rate of interaction. Nevertheless, these interactive technologies still have some limitations, such as limited mobility, high costs, setup issues, technical difficulties, and little support of higher-order thinking skills. Second, recently there has been an increasing number of {EMI} (English as Medium of Instruction) courses added to university course offerings in countries where English is not the first language. The goal of these courses is to support university internationalization and address the global status of English. However, it is even harder to achieve in-class interaction in large {EMI} lecture courses. In addition, some studies argue that {EMI} courses might affect the overall learning of course content because of students’ poor lecture comprehension and passive engagement in class. In order to address the limitations of interactive technologies, encourage more collaborative learning, facilitate greater in-class interaction in large lecture courses, and resolve students’ poor lecture comprehension in {EMI} courses, the author introduces {MEMIS} (Mobile-Supported English-Medium Instruction System), which includes both a T&amp;S (Teachers &amp; Students) mobile app and an {EMI} pedagogical method. The author first provides detailed implementation and all the features of the T&amp;S mobile app, which improves students’ perceptions of classroom participation and in-class interaction. Then the author explains how she develops her {EMI} pedagogy such that it utilizes the features of the T&amp;S mobile app to: 1) increase students’ overall learning in her {EMI} course, 2) develop students’ construction of knowledge and higher-order thinking, and 3) achieve all six cognitive processes from Bloom’s revised taxonomy. The author adapts a quasi-experimental design, statistically analyzes the effectiveness of both exam scores and final grades between a control group and an experimental group, and then asks students to evaluate their experiences and provide feedback about MEMIS. Based on both statistical results and students’ overall feedback, the author confirms that {MEMIS} is an effective approach that improves lecture comprehension, encourages more class engagement, promotes collaborative learning, and achieves better learning outcomes.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:58","2018-02-06 16:56:58","","640 - 656","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Effective teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are among the most popular sites on the Internet that are being used in almost all areas of life including education, medical, entertainment, business, and telemarketing. Unfortunately, they have become primary targets for malicious users who attempt to perform illegal activities and cause harm to other users. The unusual behavior of such users can be identified by using anomaly detection techniques. Anomaly detection in social networks refers to the problem of identifying the strange and unexpected behavior of users by exploring the patterns hidden in the networks, as the patterns of interaction of such users deviate significantly from the normal users of the networks. Even though a multitude of anomaly detection methods have been developed for different problem settings, this field is still relatively young and rapidly growing. Hence, there is a growing need for an organized study of the work done in the area of anomaly detection in social networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of a large set of methods for mining social networks for anomalies by providing a multi-level taxonomy to categorize the existing techniques based on the nature of input network, the type of anomalies they detect, and the underlying anomaly detection approach. In addition, this paper highlights the various application scenarios where these methods have been used, and explores the research challenges and open issues in this field.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","213 - 229","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of observed behaviour using computational methods can uncover patterns that reflect theoretically established processes, such as those involved in self-regulated learning (SRL). This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from fine-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identified six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based {SRL} strategies and identified three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with specific course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners. Challenges that arise in the process of extracting theory-based patterns from observed behaviour are discussed, including analytic issues and limitations of available trace data from learning platforms.","2018","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-06 16:57:08","","179 - 196","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","massive open online courses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research unveils students' deficits in understanding the behavior of structural elements in a three-dimensional (3D) context due to the shortcomings of traditional lecturing approaches, which put too much emphasis on the analysis of individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to analyzing complex structures with a large number of interconnected elements. In this paper, the authors introduce a new pedagogy for teaching structural analysis that incorporates mobile augmented reality (AR) and interactive 3D visualization technology. The goal of this study is to enhance the contents used in structural analysis textbooks and on worksheets by visualizing discrete structural members employing {AR} along with interactive 3D models in order to illustrate how the structures behave under different loading conditions. Students can interactively change the load and observe the reaction resulting from this change with the instant feedback provided by the {AR} interface. The feasibility of {AR} concepts and interaction metaphors, as well as the potential of using {AR} for teaching structural analysis are investigated, specifically by focusing on challenges regarding content integration and interaction. An {AR} application is designed and developed, and a pilot study is conducted in a junior level structural analysis class to assess the pedagogical impact and the design concepts employed by the {AR} tool. Control and test groups are deployed, and students’ performance is measured using pre- and post-tests. The results of the pilot study indicate that the utilized {AR} design concepts have potential to contribute to students’ learning by providing interactive and 3D visualization features, which support constructive engagement and retention of information in students.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","90 - 100","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the development of the tool includes a multi-level model aiming at better tailor-made advice to consumers. In this paper, we examine the EcoRunner tool with average single Swedish household expenditures as well as explore options for reductions and systems effects. Analysis shows that food and non-alcoholic beverages, fuel for personal transport (e.g. car) and air transports have significant environmental pressures.

This task includes two sub-tasks: network structure identification and associated parameters estimation. In most existing methods, the two sub-tasks are dealt with step by step, which may result in inconsistence between them and hence inaccuracy of the final model. Another challenge is how to transparently understand the derived model, which cannot be achieved by the traditional black-box methods. A human readable fuzzy rule-based model, denoted as MoPath, is developed for the identification of both structure topology and associated parameters, simultaneously, of a biological network within an optimization framework. MoPath encodes the fuzzy rules into particles of heterogeneous particle swarm optimization (CHPSO) algorithm to generate the optimal model. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the cooperation in {CHPSO} can maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation to guarantee the particles converge to stable points, which is greatly helpful for finding the optimal model consisting of both the network topology and parameters. We demonstrate MoPath on two dynamic biological networks, and successfully generate a few human readable rules that can well represent the network with high accuracy and good robustness.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:02","2018-02-06 16:59:02","","349 - 358","","2","247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dynamical system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Riots were particularly severe in Kibera, an informal settlement located within the nation's capital, Nairobi. Through the lens of geosimulation, an agent-based model is integrated with social network analysis and geographic information systems to explore how the environment and local interactions underlying Kibera, combined with an external trigger, such as a rumor, led to the emergence of riots. We ground our model on empirical data of Kibera's geospatial landscape, heterogeneous population, and daily activities of its residents. In order to effectively construct a model of riots, however, we must have an understanding of human behavior, especially that related to an individual's need for identity and the role rumors play on a person's decision to riot. This provided the foundation to develop the agents' cognitive model, which created a feedback system between the agents' activities in physical space and interactions in social space. Results showed that youth are more susceptible to rioting. Systematically increasing education and employment opportunities, however, did not have simple linear effects on rioting, or even on quality of life with respect to income and activities. The situation is more complex. By linking agent-based modeling, social network analysis, and geographic information systems we were able to develop a cognitive framework for the agents, better represent human behavior by modeling the interactions that occur over both physical and social space, and capture the nonlinear, reinforcing nature of the emergence and dissolution of riots.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","66 - 80","","","61, Part A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rumor propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are a lot of challenges in capturing, modeling, storing, and processing such data from these systems of engagement, both in terms of achieving the right balance of redundancy in the captured and stored data, along with ensuring the usefulness of the data for analysis. There are additional challenges in balancing how much of the captured data should be processed through client or server applications.

However, patients are frequently confused when information is given through traditional verbal description. The present study compared the effectiveness of the multimedia information delivery ways with the traditional verbal manner on patients’ understanding level in oral impression taking. Methods The recruited 191 participating patients were randomly assigned to the control group (the verbal group) and two intervention groups (the video group and the picture group) according to the information delivery manner. After intervention, the patients’ understanding degree was measured by questionnaire and performance evaluation of behavior feedback on the provided information quantitatively. Also, patients’ self-assessment of satisfaction was interviewed by telephone. All data was analyzed by {SPSS} 14.0 software, and p ≤ 0.05 was set as significant difference in advance. Results One-Way {ANOVA} and Chi-square showed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean age, gender composition, and educational level among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05). In both questionnaire assessment and performance evaluation, One-Way {ANOVA} followed by {LSD} indicate that the video group gained a higher score than the verbal group or the picture group (P &lt; 0.05). The questionnaire score in the picture group is significantly higher than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), but no significant difference was shown between these two groups in patients’ performance evaluation (P &gt; 0.05). Higher percentage of satisfaction was reported by patients in the two multimedia groups than that in the control group. Discussion Oral impression taking is a consecutive process that requires action cooperation between dentists and patients simultaneously. This particularity makes it more suitable for multimedia delivery. The delivery of tailored information using multimedia in this study was favored by most patients and could improve the degree of patient understanding of the oral impression taking procedures.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","150 - 155","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Understanding level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system has been tested on synthetic and real image sequences, with the aim of describing their performance for different levels of noise, occlusions, a variable number of objects, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system accurately tracks multiple objects in the scene, by grouping and ungrouping them when necessary, while keeping their identities during the sequence of images. Moreover, the performance of the proposed system is not strongly affected by the increase in the number of objects, maintaining computational load and precision in proper balance.","2010","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","1577 - 1590","","12","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Surveillance applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stochastic simulation algorithm – also known as the Gillespie algorithm – is currently the most widely used method to simulate the time course of a system of bio-chemical reactions in a stochastic way. In this article, we present a central limit theorem for the Gillespie stochastic trajectories when the living system has reached a steady-state, that is when the internal bio-molecules concentrations are assumed to be at equilibrium. It appears that the stochastic behavior in steady-state is entirely characterized by the stoichiometry matrix of the system and a single vector of reaction probabilities. We propose several applications of this result such as deriving multivariate confidence regions for the time course of the system and a constraints-based approach which extends the flux balance analysis framework to the stochastic case.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","67 - 82","","","316","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Random walks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show the importance of considering the proposed model on guiding courseware development for education, especially on the music education context. Moreover, we noticed through a qualitative analysis that the students seemed to be more motivated when using social and sound manipulation integrated resources because of their perception of learning opportunities, social influence, ease of use, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions and usage intention.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","760 - 770","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion are base course materials comprising 25% reclaimed asphalt pavement and 75% natural aggregates with and without 1% cement. A 3D-finite difference model was used to determine the response of these pavement sections when subjected to two types of loads with four types of soil subgrades of varying resistances. A nonlinear elasto–plastic Mohr-Coulomb model was used in the two materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion, and a nonlinear model was adopted in the four soil subgrades. Both the resilient and permanent behaviours of these materials were modelled. An analysis was conducted on rutting and fatigue resistances of the base course materials. The base course material containing 1% cement is more resistant and is apt for use in lightly trafficked rural roads. Both base course materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion will first fail from rutting before fatigue.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:40","2018-02-06 16:57:40","","69 - 79","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bitumen emulsion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, for multimodal cost functions these procedures may lead to local minima, therefore, the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based procedures are considered as promising alternatives. In this paper we focus on a memetic algorithm based approach for training the multilayer perceptron NN applied to nonlinear system identification. The proposed memetic algorithm is an alternative to gradient search methods, such as back-propagation and back-propagation with momentum which has inherent limitations of many local optima. Here we have proposed the identification of a nonlinear system using memetic differential evolution (DE) algorithm and compared the results with other six algorithms such as Back-propagation (BP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm Back-propagation (GABP), Particle Swarm Optimization combined with Back-propagation (PSOBP). In the proposed system identification scheme, we have exploited DE to be hybridized with the back propagation algorithm, i.e. differential evolution back-propagation (DEBP) where the local search BP algorithm is used as an operator to DE. These algorithms have been tested on a standard benchmark problem for nonlinear system identification to prove their efficacy. First examples shows the comparison of different algorithms which proves that the proposed DEBP is having better identification capability in comparison to other. In example 2 good behavior of the identification method is tested on an one degree of freedom (1DOF) experimental aerodynamic test rig, a twin rotor multi-input–multi-output system (TRMS), finally it is applied to Box and Jenkins Gas furnace benchmark identification problem and its efficacy has been tested through correlation analysis.","2011-05","2018-02-21 12:52:48","2018-02-21 12:52:48","","1696-1709","","10","74","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Back propagation; Differential evolution; Evolutionary computation; Nonlinear system identification; Particle swarm optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for {FACS} action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","641 - 647","","10","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","head motion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed NA-LMS/F algorithm is realized by incorporating a p-norm-like into the cost function of the conventional least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) which acts as a combination of the l0- and l1-norm constraints. A reweighted NA-LMS/F (RNA-LMS/F) algorithm is also developed by adding a reweighted factor in the NA-LMS/F algorithm. The proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm exhibits an improved performance in terms of the convergence speed and the steady-state error, which can provide a zero attractor to further exploit the sparsity of the channel by the use of the norm adaption penalty and the reweighting factor. The simulation results obtained from the sparse channel estimations are given to verify that our proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm is superior to the previously reported sparse-aware LMS/F and the conventional LMS/F algorithms in terms of both the convergence speed and the steady-state behavior.","2016-11","2018-02-21 12:52:39","2018-02-21 12:52:39","","243-251","","","128","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filter; Least mean square/fourth; Norm-adaption penalty; Sparse channel estimation; Zero attracting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, this paper introduces to electrical and computer engineering (ECE) students the techno-pedagogical (TP) method that is suitable for designing {BPL} networks in underground distribution power grids. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, using the already verified hybrid method and the proposed {TP} method, the underground LV/BPL transmission channel is investigated with regard to its spectral behavior, the usable bandwidth and the end-to-end signal attenuation. Both methods agree that the above features depend on the frequency, the physical properties of the cables used, the end-to-end –“LOS”– distance, and the number, the electrical length and the termination of the branches encountered along the end-to-end {BPL} signal propagation. Second, {TP} method reveals the broadband transmission potential of underground LV/BPL networks to {ECE} students in a simple way; underground {LV} power grids are a potentially excellent communications medium, offering low-loss characteristics over 200 m repeater span well beyond 100 MHz. Third, {ECE} students can understand the coexistence opportunities of {BPL} systems with other existing broadband telecommunications technologies in a unified distribution smart grid (SG) environment.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","253 - 260","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This situation calls for the implementation of health-related information and communication technologies (ICT) to assist in providing more cost-effective healthcare to the elderly. In order for such a measure to succeed, older adults must be prepared to adopt these technologies. Prior research shows, however, that this population lags behind in {ICT} adoption, although some believe that this is a temporary phenomenon that will soon change. Objectives To assess use by older adults of technology in general and {ICT} in particular, in order to evaluate their readiness to adopt health-related ICT. Method We employed the questionnaire used by Selwyn et al. in 2000 in the UK, as well as a survey instrument used by Morris and Venkatesh, to examine the validity of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in the context of computer use by older employees. 123 respondents answered the questions via face-to-face interviews, 63 from the {US} and 60 from Israel. {SPSS} 17.0 was used for the data analysis. Results The results show that although there has been some increase in adoption of modern technologies, including ICT, most of the barriers found by Selwyn et al. are still valid. {ICT} use was determined by accessibility of computers and support and by age, marital status, education, and health. Health, however, was found to moderate the effect of age, healthier older people being far more likely to use computers than their unhealthy coevals. The {TPB} was only partially supported, since only perceived behavioral control (PBC) emerged as significantly affecting intention to use a computer, while age, contrary to the findings of Morris and Venkatesh, interacted differently for Americans and Israelis. The main reason for non-use was ‘no interest’ or ‘no need’, similar to findings from data collected in 2000. Conclusions Adoption of technology by older adults is still limited, though it has increased as compared with results of the previous study. Modern technologies have been adopted (albeit selectively) by older users, who were presumably strongly motivated by perceived usefulness. Particularly worrying are the effects of health, PBC, and the fact that many older adults do not share the perception that {ICT} can significantly improve their quality of life. We therefore maintain that older adults are not yet ready to adopt health-related ICT. Health-related {ICT} for the elderly should be kept simple and demonstrate substantial benefits, and special attention should be paid to training and support and to specific personal and cultural characteristics. These are mandatory conditions for adoption by potential unhealthy and older consumers.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-06 16:59:09","","e209 - e231","","11","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Healthcare {ICT}","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a series of conversation tests, it is shown that transmission delay in a telephone circuit does not only result in a longer time until information is exchanged between the interlocutors, but also alters various characteristics of the conversational course. It was observed that with increasing transmission delay, the realities perceived by the interlocutors increasingly diverge. As a measure of utterance pace, a new conversation surface structure metric, the so-called utterance rhythm (URY), is introduced. Using surface-structure analysis of conversations from different conversation tests, it is shown that peoples’ utterance rhythm stays rather constant in close-to-natural conversations, but is considerably affected for scenarios requiring fast interaction and a clear answering structure. At the same time, the quality of the connection is perceived less critically in close-to-natural than in tasks requiring fast interaction, that is, interactive tasks leading to a delay-dependant utterance rhythm. Hence, the conclusion can be drawn that the degree of necessary adaption of the utterance rhythm to a certain delay condition co-determines the extent to which transmission delay impacts the perceived integral quality of a call.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","1 - 14","","","63–64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conversational quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to previous works on this subject, in which the step-size optimization is rooted on the assumption of specific channel models, this analysis is much more generic in respect to the modelling of both the Doppler and delay spreadings. Besides, it addresses not only the steady-state performance of channel estimators, but also their transient behaviors. Several useful approximate expressions for designing LMS-based channel estimators are herein derived and validated by comparisons with simulation and with a previous work on this kind of analysis. These expressions are remarkably suitable for practical application, since they depend on a few parameters of the communication system. With regard to the channel variability, the knowledge of the Doppler spread parameter is shown to be enough to optimize the performance of a LMS channel estimator using the analysis here presented.","2013-01","2018-02-21 12:52:35","2018-02-21 12:52:35","","281-288","","1","23","","Digital Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Channel estimation; Doppler spread; LMS algorithm; Step-size parameter; WSS-US channels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, decision makers in industry are usually not statisticians, mathematicians, systems engineers, or {AI} experts. So it is important, to organize the results of the data analysis process and to present it in a form that can be easily interpreted by non-experts. One of the potential drawbacks affecting the application of computational intelligence (CI) methods in general to the analysis of data is the often limited interpretability of the results they yield. One way to overcome interpretability limitations is by explaining the operation of {CI} models using rule extraction methods. The interpretability of the model results should be greatly improved by their description in terms of reasonably simple and actionable rules that decision makers could rely on. In fact, rule extraction should provide whom the final responsibility for taking decisions rests, with an explanation about how a {CI} or related computer-based method has reached its decision. This paper describes a novel rule-extraction algorithm based on fuzzy logic, name LR-FIR (linguistic rules in FIR), that starts from the fuzzy inductive reasoning (FIR) methodology. {FIR} is able to obtain good qualitative relationships between the variables that compose the system and to predict the future behaviour of that system. The proposed algorithm (LR-FIR) is able to derive linguistic rules from a {FIR} model. The LR-FIR functioning is similar to those used in Boolean algebra. However the premises and consequences of rules are not necessarily binary in nature, hence the algorithm must be able to deal with multi-valued logic, and accept partial do-not-care conditions. Due to the fact that LR-FIR was developed within the {FIR} methodology, the obtained rules could be considered as predictive rules and deal naturally with the uncertainty captured in the {FIR} models. LR-FIR, in this paper, was evaluated using five data-sets from different domains: e-learning, global change temperature, brain tumour diagnosis, and two of the most used classical {UCI} data-sets: {IRIS} and Pima Indian Diabetes. The rules extracted by LR-FIR capture the main behaviour of each application, from the domain experts’ point of view, demonstrating in this sense, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","2011","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","3463 - 3475","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pima Indian Diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The investigation of this interdependency comprises of the following four cases: (1) nonlinear primary path, nonlinear stability problem, (2) linear primary path, nonlinear stability problem, (3) nonlinear primary path, linear stability problem, and (4) linear primary path, linear stability problem. The consistently linearized eigenproblem is used for differentiation of two classes of nonlinear stability problems with markedly different characteristics of both the prebuckling and the postbuckling behavior. For one of them, e.g. zero-stiffness postbuckling is impossible. For the other one, which is restricted to a prebuckling regime with axial deformations only, sensitivity analysis of the initial postbuckling behavior either exhibits its continuous improvement or its continuous deterioration, depending on whether the bifurcation point diverges from or converges to the snap-through point. In other words, a monotonic variation of the design parameter cannot result in a non-monotonic change of the initial postbuckling behavior. The practical motivation for this work is to explore the mechanical reasons for qualitatively different modes of transition from imperfection sensitivity to insensitivity in the course of sensitivity analysis for the purpose of improving the postbuckling behavior of structures by means of minor design changes. Results from a numerical investigation corroborate the theoretical findings.","2011","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","1558 - 1567","","13–16","200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zero-stiffness postbuckling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In implementing any learning system such as mobile learning, users’ expectations should be taken into consideration. However, there is a lack of studies on this aspect, particularly in the context of Kuwait higher education (HE) institutions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate students’ and instructors’ perceptions toward the use of mobile devices in learning, and to understand the challenges that affect its implementation. Although m-learning is used in the developed countries and considered as an effective educational tool, it is not yet fully utilized in Kuwait, as a developing country. This study reports on the results of a survey conducted on 623 students, and 132 instructors from {HE} institutions in Kuwait, in order to understand their perceptions and opinions about the effectiveness of the use of mobile learning. An analysis of the quantitative survey findings is presented in this article, and the findings indicated that students and instructors are very familiar with mobile devices and its applications. The results also revealed that students and instructors have positive perceptions of m-learning, and indicated that video-based social media applications are widely used among them. However, the study reports some social and cultural issues that may act as barriers to m-learning implementation.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:56","2018-02-06 16:57:56","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Perceptions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main intention of the attacker is to kill or modify the behavior of the agent in the middle of the journey to degrade the trustiness of the agent environment. To recover the killed or modified mobile agent in the original form, this paper proposed a novel K-response recovery model. For K-response recovery model, every host dispatching the agent should have the clone to recover the agent and send the response to the preceding host about the agent status (alive). During the recovery of the mobile agent all the components (agent code, itinerary, credential information, collected information and state) are able to recover. The K-response model is experimented for the 1-response scenario and its experimental results proved that the preceding host will get the response with in the time out period of the clone.","2010","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","38 - 43","","1–2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In current analyses of ACLMS, it is implicitly or explicitly assumed that the length of the adaptive filter is equal to that of the unknown system’s impulse response (optimal model order). In many applications, however, the length of the adaptive filter is smaller than required, the so called deficient length case, which renders the analysis for a ‘sufficient length’ ACLMS inadequate. To this end, we examine the statistical behaviour of the ACLMS algorithm in undermodelling situations. Exact expressions are developed to completely characterise both the transient and steady-state mean and mean square performances of the deficient length ACLMS for general second order noncircular Gaussian input signals. This is achieved using the recently introduced approximate uncorrelating transform (AUT), in order to jointly diagonalise the covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices with a single singular value decomposition (SVD), which both simplifies the analysis and enables a link between the degree of input noncircularity and the steady state mean square error (MSE) performance of the deficient length ACLMS. Simulations in system identification settings support the analysis.","2018-03","2018-02-21 12:52:29","2018-02-21 12:52:29","","214-225","","","144","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Approximate uncorrelating transform (AUT); Augmented complex LMS (ACLMS); Deficient length adaptive filter; Mean square analysis; Second order noncircularity (improperness); Widely linear model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In SAEC applications, using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm, it is usually assumed that the lengths of the adaptive filters are equal to that of the unidentified system responses. Although, in many realistic situations, under-modelled lengths adaptive filters, whose lengths are less than that of the unidentified systems (under-modelled systems), are employed, and analysis results for the exact modelled stereophonic LMS algorithm are not automatically appropriate to the under-modeled lengths. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis of the under-modeled stereophonic LMS algorithm. Exact expressions and deterministic recursive equations to the mean coefficients behavior of the adaptive LMS filters are derived to completely characterize and assess the performances (transient and steady-state) of the under-modeling stereophonic LMS algorithm. The expected theoretical behaviour is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and practical experimental results, showing a very good agreement.","2012-11","2018-02-21 12:52:41","2018-02-21 12:52:41","","1579-1594","","6","38","","Computers & Electrical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It characterises the schedules robustness or lack thereof and provides unique profiles of performance for different sources of delay and for different values of delay. An approach like this is necessary because train schedules are only a prediction of what will actually happen. They can perform poorly with respect to a variety of performance metrics, when deviations and other delays occur, if for instance they can even be implemented, and as originally intended. The information provided by this analytical approach is beneficial because it can be used as part of a proactive scheduling approach to alter a schedule in advance or to identify suitable courses of action for specific “bad behaviour”. Furthermore this information may be used to quantify the cost of delay. The effect of sectional running time (SRT) deviations and additional dwell time in particular were quantified for three railway schedule performance measures. The key features of this approach were demonstrated in a case study.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","98 - 114","","4","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Railways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate this question in the context of chronic disease self-management with the focus on type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods We conducted an observational qualitative study of discovery with personal data among adults attending a diabetes self-management education (DSME) program that utilized a discovery-based curriculum. The study included observations of class sessions, and interviews and focus groups with the educator and attendees of the program (n = 14). Results The main discovery in diabetes self-management evolved around discovering patterns of association between characteristics of individuals’ activities and changes in their blood glucose levels that the participants referred to as “cause and effect”. This discovery empowered individuals to actively engage in self-management and provided a desired flexibility in selection of personalized self-management strategies. We show that discovery of cause and effect involves four essential phases: (1) feature selection, (2) hypothesis generation, (3) feature evaluation, and (4) goal specification. Further, we identify opportunities to support discovery at each stage with informatics and data visualization solutions by providing assistance with: (1) active manipulation of collected data (e.g., grouping, filtering and side-by-side inspection), (2) hypotheses formulation (e.g., using natural language statements or constructing visual queries), (3) inference evaluation (e.g., through aggregation and visual comparison, and statistical analysis of associations), and (4) translation of discoveries into actionable goals (e.g., tailored selection from computable knowledge sources of effective diabetes self-management behaviors). Discussion The study suggests that discovery of cause and effect in diabetes can be a powerful approach to helping individuals to improve their self-management strategies, and that self-monitoring data can serve as a driving engine for personal discovery that may lead to sustainable behavior changes. Conclusions Enabling personal discovery is a promising new approach to enhancing chronic disease self-management with informatics interventions.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:08","2018-02-06 16:58:08","","1 - 8","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Self-care (N02.421.784.680)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results presented and discussed were obtained by means of analyses performed using the finite element code Abaqus and adopting column discretisations into fine 4-node isoparametric shell element meshes. The columns analysed (i) are simply supported (locally/globally pinned end sections that may warp freely), (ii) have cross-section dimensions and lengths that ensure equal distortional and global (flexural–torsional) critical buckling loads, thus maximising the distortional/global mode interaction effects, and (iii) contain critical-mode initial geometrical imperfections exhibiting different configurations, all corresponding to linear combinations of the two “competing” critical buckling modes. After briefly addressing the lipped channel column “pure” distortional and global post-buckling behaviours, one presents and discusses in great detail a fair number of numerical results concerning the post-buckling behaviour and strength of similar columns experiencing strong distortional/global mode interaction effects. These results consist of (i) elastic (mostly) and elastic–plastic non-linear equilibrium paths, (ii) curves or figures providing the evolution of the deformed configurations of several columns (expressed as linear combination of their distortional and global components) and, for the elastic–plastic columns, (iii) figures enabling a clear visualisation of (iii1) the location and growth of the plastic strains and (iii2) the characteristics of the failure mechanisms more often detected in the course of this research work.","2011","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","422 - 434","","3–4","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Column strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the benefits of {DBT} in breast cancer screening rely on well trained radiologists, the optimal training regimen in {DBT} is unknown. We propose a computer-aided educational system that individually selects the optimal training cases for each trainee. The first step towards this goal is to capture the individual weaknesses of each trainee. In this study, we present and evaluate a computer algorithm for this purpose with particular focus on false negative errors. Methods We developed an algorithm (a user model) that predicted the likelihood of a trainee missing an abnormal location. An individual model is applied for each trainee. The algorithm consists of three steps. First, the lesions on {DBT} images are segmented by a 3D active contour method with a level set algorithm. Then, 16 features are extracted automatically for the segmented lesions. Finally a multivariate logistic regression classifier predicts the likelihood of error based on the extracted features. The classifier is trained using the previous interpretation data of the trainee. We evaluated the individual predictive algorithms experimentally using data from a reader study in which 29 trainees and 3 expert breast radiologists read 60 {DBT} cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, along with a repeated holdout approach, was used to evaluate the predictive performance of our algorithm. Results The average area under the {ROC} curve (AUC) of the algorithms which predicted which lesions will be detected and which will be missed by a specific trainee was 0.627 (95% CI: 0.579–0.675). The average performance was statistically significantly better than chance (p&lt;0.001). Under the status quo, training involves no specific strategy for case presentation, and this random behavior corresponds to {AUC} of 0.5. Therefore, the proposed algorithm may provide a significant improvement in distinguishing abnormal locations that will be detected by a trainee from those that will be missed. Conclusions Our algorithm was able to distinguish abnormal locations that will be detected by a trainee from those that will be missed. This could be used to enrich the training set with cases that are likely to prompt error for the individual trainee while still maintaining a range of cases necessary for comprehensive education.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","1 - 8","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tomosynthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In today's diverse student population, E-learning must recognize the differences in student personalities to make the learning process more personalized. The objective of this study is to create a data model to identify both the student personality type and the dominant preference based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) theory. The proposed model utilizes data from student engagement with the learning management system (Moodle) and the social network, Facebook. The model helps students become aware of their personality, which in turn makes them more efficient in their study habits. The model also provides vital information for educators, equipping them with a better understanding of each student's personality. With this knowledge, educators will be more capable of matching students with their respective learning styles. The proposed model was applied on a sample data collected from the Business College at the German university in Cairo, Egypt (240 students). The model was tested using 10 data mining classification algorithms which were NaiveBayes, BayesNet, Kstar, Random forest, J48, OneR, JRIP, KNN /IBK, RandomTree, Decision Table. The results showed that OneR had the best accuracy percentage of 97.40%, followed by Random forest 93.23% and J48 92.19%.","2015-10-07","2018-02-21 12:59:16","2018-02-21 12:59:16","","294-299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accuracy; Bayes methods; BayesNet; Classification algorithms; data-driven model; data mining; Data mining; datamining; data mining classification algorithms; Data models; decision table; decision tables; dominant preference; educational system; e-learning; Electronic learning; Facebook; IBK; J48; JRIP; KNN; kolb; Kstar; learning management system; learning management systems; learning style; Least squares approximations; LMS; MBTI theory; moodle; Moodle; myers-briggs; Myers-Briggs type indicator theory; naive Bayes; OneR; pattern classification; random forest; random processes; random tree; social networking (online); social networks; Social network services; student behavior; student engagement; student personality prediction; student personality type; trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such courses have generated extensive interest, there is as yet sparse literature evaluating the determinants of online course acceptance, especially in developing countries. Seeking to close this gap, this study examines the factors influencing students’ adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in a developing country by applying an integrated framework incorporating the task-technology fit model, social motivation, and self-determination theory. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of perceived reputation on students’ adoption behavior. A self-administered survey was employed for data collection and valid responses from 414 participants were used for testing the proposed model. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling through Smart-PLS. The results establish the significant contribution of task characteristics and technology characteristics in facilitating task-technology fit, and that the fit positively influences behavioral intentions.

This research also reveals that perceived reputation has an important moderating effect on the students’ usage behavior.

There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the usersʼ personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","57 - 71","","1","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Personality inference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that {LLNs} differ from traditional ad hoc networks not only due to node capacity, but also in the nature of traffic generation and routing requirements. This study aims at a fair comparison between two protocols proposed at the IETF, namely {RPL} (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) – the proactive candidate, and {LOADng} (LLN On-demand Ad-hoc Distance vector routing protocol – next generation) – the reactive candidate, making use of real traffic scenarios and topology deployments of varied size, as well as random topologies in the particular case of metrics relating to scalability. Several metrics of interest are investigated, including metrics that have not been paid much attention in the existing {MANET} literature. In the course of this investigation, we also uncovered non-optimal protocol behavior for the case of large networks and proposed new mechanisms that are shown to improve control plane congestion, as a result improving network lifetime for large scale LLNs. We also derive bounds on control overhead for the two protocols, which indicate that {RPL} incurs an overhead that is lower than O ( N 2 ) and reduces to Θ ( N log ( N ) ) for a balanced tree structure, whereas {LOADng} has a total control overhead of Θ ( N 2 ) , irrespective of topology.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:11","2018-02-06 16:59:11","","121 - 144","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LOADng","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, not many research publications have been written observing the characteristics of a modeling process itself that can be associated with better/worse learning outcomes, nor have any empirically validated results been reported on the observations of modeling activities in the educational context. This paper attempts to cover this gap for conceptual modeling. We analyze modeling behavior (conceptual modeling event data of 20 cases, 10.000 events in total) using experimental logging functionality of the {JMermaid} modeling tool and process mining techniques. The outcomes of the work include modeling patterns that are indicative for worse/better learning performance. The results contribute to (1) improving teaching guidance for conceptual modeling targeted at process-oriented feedback, (2) providing recommendations on the type of data that can be useful in observing a modeling behavior from the perspective of learning outcomes.

This work outlines a novel approach for analyzing behavioral learner data through the application of process mining techniques specifically targeting a complex problem solving process. We realize this in the context of one particular learning case, namely, domain modeling. This work extends our previous research on process-mining analysis of domain modeling behavior of novices by elaborating with new insights from a replication study enhanced with an extra observation on how novices verify/validate models. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the results contribute to improving our knowledge on the cognitive aspects of problem-solving behavior of novices in the area of domain modeling, specifically regarding process-oriented feedback as opposed to traditional outcome feedback (is a solution correct? Why (not)?) usually applied in this type of courses. Ultimately, the outcomes of the work can be inspirational outside of the area of domain modeling as learning event data is becoming readily available through virtual learning environments and other information systems.","2016","2018-02-06 16:56:36","2018-02-21 13:56:48","","352 - 376","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conceptual modeling; Domain modeling; Information systems education; learning analytics; Learning analytics; Modeling patterns; Process mining; Process-oriented feedback; Teaching/learning modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much research has focused on whether exergames foster sufficient physical activity and with which intensity they do so. This is usually measured through energy expenditure and compared to traditional physical activities such as sports or physical education exercises. However, little research has been undertaken on the quality of the physical activity, understood not as how well the movement is done, but as the richness and diversity of physical activity defined by experts, such as diverse types of motor skills (jumps, turns, pivots, manipulative actions, etc) and diverse types of conditioning capabilities (endurance, stretch, general strength, coordination, etc.). Hence, exergames typically address only aerobic (cardiovascular) activity and other types tend to be ignored. In this paper we propose a method for analyzing the types of physical activity (quality) that an exertion interface elicits. We propose this method as an analytical tool which can provide key information to categorize exergames, aid to their design and help designers make sure they achieve game mechanics that elicit the desired types of physical activity. We describe the method through the analysis of two exergames that we developed in the past for our exertion interface for children, called the Interactive Slide. We present the results of a systematic observational method, until now used mainly in sports analysis, which is based on applying sequential body movement analysis to obtain the play characteristics of 48 children. These results -action events and time-based patterns- typify the movement found in the two aforementioned exergames for this platform. We have found significant movement differences between the two, as well as some differences associated to age. Moreover, we show that sequential body movement analysis, which has already been successfully used in the past to analyze sports, can also be effective in analyzing exergames and hence allow grounded discussion on health issues related to their use.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:33","2018-02-06 16:57:33","","67 - 78","","","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Full-body Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Internet is an essential tool for improving learning efficiency by analyzing how learners select courses; it is also a convenient channel to extract learner preferences. We adopt dynamic learning data from a popular Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) website in China, imooc.com, to detect the online learning behavior pattern of Chinese online learners and estimate herding behavior. Considering the large number of similar online courses, this study determines how a suitable course can be selected. We first evince the existence of herding in online learning and then divide herding behavior into different groups: some learners passively mimic their peers (irrational herding), whereas some learners engage in active observational learning according to their needs (rational herding). The results reveal that rational herding dominates online learning. Subsequently, some variables amplify the herding effect, such as the difficulty level of the course and the experience of the learners. We conclude that the higher the difficulty level of a course, the more the rational herding of the learners and that the more experienced the learners, the higher the rational herding. This study provides implications for the way in course selection in MOOC, specifically in the learning analytics of the online learners.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:36","2018-02-21 13:56:55","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Herding behavior; MOOC; online learning; Online learning; Rational herding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there has been no detailed study of its performance. In this paper, we provide an analytical treatment of the ensemble-average learning curve of the RI algorithm. A novel analytical result which describes the learning behavior of the RI algorithm is obtained. It is shown that within limits of approximation, the excess mean-square-error (MSE) of the algorithm approaches zero and the RI algorithm converges to a lower steady-state MSE than the LMS algorithm. The results show that the theoretical and experimental MSE curves of the RI algorithm are in agreement. Also, the MSE analysis of the RI algorithm in a nonstationary environment, where the optimum weight is assumed to be randomly changing about a fixed vector, is derived.","2017-07","2018-02-21 12:52:31","2018-02-21 12:52:31","","10-17","","","66","","Digital Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Excess MSE; LMS algorithm; Mean-square-error; RLS algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

House-based strategies are therefore required to complement the landscape strategies in order to reduce the extent of house loss. Here we use a Bayesian Network approach to quantify the relative influence of preventative and suppressive management strategies on the probability of house loss in Australia. Community education had a limited effect on the extent to which residents prepared their property hence a limited effect on the reduction in risk of house loss, however hypothetically improving property preparedness did reduce the risk of house loss. Increasing expenditure on suppression resources resulted in a greater reduction in the risk of loss than preparedness. This increase had an interaction effect with increasing the distance between vegetation and the houses. The extent to which any one action can be implemented is limited by social, environmental and economic factors.","2015","2018-02-06 16:57:38","2018-02-06 16:57:38","","12 - 25","","","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fire management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposal is based on the premise that the technology used in AR, such as mobile devices, is familiar to the student. When used in a collaborative manner, the technology is able to achieve a greater level of direct engagement with the proposed content, thereby improving academic outcomes. The objective was to assess the feasibility of using {AR} on mobile devices in educational environments and to investigate the relationship between the usability of the tool, student participation, and the improvement in academic performance after using AR. The validation was performed through a case study in which students were able to experience a virtual construction process overlapped onto real environments. Results were obtained by students’ pre-tests and post-tests. In line with our assumptions, the use of mobile devices in the classroom is highly correlated with motivation, and there is a significant correlation with academic achievement. However, the difficulty of using and generating content is a complex factor that suggests difficulty when implementing more complicated models.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:17","2018-02-06 16:57:17","","434 - 445","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","user experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results revealed our methodological and analytical approach shows promise for investigating technology acceptance over time on subjects where little literature exists and where recruiting adequate sample sizes for statistical power purposes may be challenging. Results of the data analysis showed there was a significant and reliable linear trend on subjective norm. Time did not predict perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, or behavioral intention, indicating the levels of these factors were high and stable over the course of the study. Older adults accepted remote patient monitoring, and family and friends may influence technology acceptance promoting behaviors.

Attention to social influence to optimize the implementation of in-home health monitoring among this population is warranted.

Nevertheless, research on the assessment of ColPS is at its initial stage; specifically, assessments of synchronous student-student ColPS in digital environments have been scarcely investigated, and there is an ample need for valid and reliable assessments to measure ColPS. The present study attempts to fill this gap by proposing a novel ColPS task and investigating students' ColPS skills with the help of think-aloud protocols while they were taking an online performance-based test. The task was developed on the basis of a ColPS framework, and principles emphasized in the research literature on students’ interaction, collaboration, and problem solving were implemented. A real-world problem mimicking a common teaching and learning situation formed the context of this task. The empirical evidence obtained from the think-aloud protocols of eleven Norwegian students displayed the strengths and weaknesses of the task, and strengthened the feasibility to assess ColPS. Implications for the future design of ColPS tasks are discussed.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","509 - 525","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Think-aloud protocol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nonnegative least-mean-square (NNLMS) algorithm was derived to address such problems in an online way. This algorithm builds on a fixed-point iteration strategy driven by the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. It was shown to provide low variance estimates, but it however suffers from unbalanced convergence rates of these estimates. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a variant of the NNLMS algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of its behavior in terms of transient learning curve, steady-state and tracking performance. We also introduce an extension of the algorithm for online sparse system identification. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and to validate the theoretical results.","2016-11","2018-02-21 12:52:35","2018-02-21 12:52:35","","131-141","","","128","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Behavior analysis; Nonnegativity constraints; Online system identification; Sparse system identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we report our progress on the development of a framework which exploits human sensorimotor learning capability to address this aim. The idea is to place the human operator in the robot control loop where he/she can intuitively control the robot, and by practice, learn to perform the target task with the robot. Subsequently, by analyzing the robot control obtained by the human, it is possible to design a controller that allows the robot to autonomously perform the task. First, we introduce this framework with the ball-swapping task where a robot hand has to swap the position of the balls without dropping them, and present new analyses investigating the intrinsic dimension of the ball-swapping skill obtained through this framework. Then, we present new experiments toward obtaining an autonomous grasp controller on an anthropomorphic robot. In the experiments, the operator directly controls the (simulated) robot using visual feedback to achieve robust grasping with the robot. The data collected is then analyzed for inferring the grasping strategy discovered by the human operator. Finally, a method to generalize grasping actions using the collected data is presented, which allows the robot to autonomously generate grasping actions for different orientations of the target object.","2012","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","441 - 451","","3","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Robot manipulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the continuous growth of bandwidth and massive amount of packets pose serious challenges for efficacious and accurate application identification. In this paper, we develop a new method to reduce the number of packets being processed while achieving the goal of accurate {P2P} and VoIP application identification. Firstly, we employ the Bi-flow model to aggregate traffic packets into Bi-flow, which can capture the exchange behavior characteristics between different terminals. Then we employ the signature of Packet Size Distribution (PSD) to capture flow dynamics, which is defined as the payload length distribution probability of the packets in one Bi-flow. Secondly, we collect {PSD} of several different {P2P} and VoIP applications and the analysis results show that {PSD} of different applications are different with each other, which can be used as features to perform traffic identification. We also find the {PSD} characteristics of one Bi-flow can be captured by its first few packets, which demonstrate our methods can identify the Bi-flow quickly after its establishment. We employ the Renyi cross entropy to perform identification by calculating the similarity between {PSD} of the Bi-flow being identified and that of specific application. If the similarity is higher than a selected threshold, the Bi-flow being identified is classified to the specific application. Finally, as the {PSD} is a type of probability feature which is not sensitive to packet lose, we integrate the Poisson sampling method into our framework to process the massive data in backbone networks. Experimental results using the artificial and actual traces collected from monitoring platform in the Northwest Center of {CERNET} (China Education and Research Network) verify the accuracy and robustness of our method.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:01","2018-02-06 16:59:01","","152 - 162","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sampling method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-eﬃcacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-eﬃcacy directly.

At present, on the major online auction sites, there exist three popular selling formats, namely, the posted price, pure auction and buy-price auction formats. It is an important decision problem for a firm to select the most profitable format to sell its products through the Internet. The customer behavior is of course a crucial element of the decision process. To the best of our knowledge, most models available today assume that customers are perfectly rational. To better understand the decision process, in this paper, we incorporate the concept of bounded rationality into consideration. We first present a “behavior choice function” to characterize the behavior of the customers with bounded rationality. Then corresponding to each selling format, we construct a revenue model based on the bounded rationality for analysis. Finally, we conduct some elaborate computational experiments to investigate the performance of each revenue model for developing new managerial insights. Our computational results clearly demonstrate how the bounded rationality of customer behavior affects the choice of a preferable selling format for a {B2C} firm in an online auction.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:50","2018-02-06 16:57:50","","139 - 153","","1","226","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Revenue management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most common risky behaviors among young people is sexualized behavior, which is promoted in social networks due to an interface that makes content exchange easier, for example, by sharing pictures, messages, videos, etc. This study's aim is to analyze the sexualized behaviors displayed by adolescents and young people on their Facebook profiles and the factors that allow for their distribution over social networks. In order to achieve this objective, a content analysis was performed over the course of 12 months using 100 profiles of teenagers and adolescents in Spain between 14 and 21 years of age. The results revealed differences in gender for these types of behaviors, and vulnerability factors were found to be part of this problem. The self presentation in the digital egocentrism and digital narcissism strengthen sexualized behaviors. Selfies represent a particular way of communicating with others and are responsible for most of the sexualized behaviors. Finally, avoiding the creation and/or diffusion of sexualized behaviors is highly important, and there is an urgent need to educate young people so they can learn how to manage their virtual media.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","219 - 226","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Selfie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features support both students and professionals. Students can study all of the major classes of neural networks in a familiar graphical setting, and can easily modify simulations, experimenting with networks and immediately seeing the results of their interventions. With the 3.0 release, Simbrain supports models on the order of thousands of neurons and a million synapses. This allows the same features that support education to support research professionals, who can now use the tool to quickly design, run, and analyze the behavior of large, highly customizable simulations.","2016","2018-02-06 16:56:48","2018-02-06 16:56:48","","1 - 10","","","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","network visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an automatable procedure, the structural behaviour of timber containing knots is simulated on the basis of a few geometrical data obtained by surface scans. To generate {FE} models automatically, two meshing procedures are introduced. The fibre course is determined numerically using a flow-grain analogy. Elastic, plastic and fracture mechanically based macroscopic material models are used to represent the mechanical properties of homogeneous wood, free of inhomogeneities. The procedure is used to compute global material parameters, as the global longitudinal elasticity modulus and tensile strength similar to {EN} 338 and therefore can be used for numerical timber grading. For comparison, experiments are considered where the global elasticity modulus and the ultimate load have been determined in tensile tests. The tests are simulated for selected boards. Possible failure zones are identified by the application of plasticity models. To determine the ultimate load at tensile loading numerically, cohesive elements are applied.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-06 16:57:19","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fracture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (N = 114) were aged 17–25 years. The standard {TPB} constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control were assessed in an online survey, as well as the additional predictors of anticipated regret, moral norm, mobile phone involvement, and cognitive capture. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed the standard constructs accounted for 67%, 56%, and 65% of variance in intentions to initiate, monitor/read, and respond, respectively, with the extended variables contributing additional variance. For initiating behaviour, for example, attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and cognitive capture all had significant, positive relationships with intention, while moral norm had a significant, negative relationship. For responding behaviour, attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and cognitive capture all had significant, positive relationships with intention, while anticipated action regret had a significant, negative relationship. These different combinations of significant predictors of intentions for each of the three behaviours (i.e., initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding) suggest that they may be distinct and require different public education message content to influence young drivers’ behaviours.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:07","2018-02-06 16:57:07","","174 - 183","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive capture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly, it is currently unknown how socioeconomic background could exert indirect influences. Adolescents from particular social strata who require assistance remain unidentified. Based on Problem Behavior Theory, a conceptual model with three layers, namely socioeconomic indicators, school-related psychosocial variables and pattern of Internet use, was formulated and tested with the survey data of 744 students from two Hong Kong secondary schools. Path analysis was conducted to yield an explanatory model of PIU. Findings suggested two different roles socioeconomic background plays. First, it potentially exerts influence as an antecedent through intermediary determinants, such as educational stress. Second, it potentially moderates the mechanism. In particular, it was found that parental education and family income significantly moderate the association between the amount of Internet use and severity of PIU. According to these findings, public health policies could be more focused on adolescents belonging to certain social strata who require additional assistance. Also, school policies and parenting strategies could be better informed with reference to the relevant psychosocial variables and pattern of Internet use.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","121 - 136","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Problematic Internet use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few process theories or potential general theories have been proposed and little empirical evaluation has been attempted. Objective The purpose of this paper is to empirically evaluate two previously untested software development process theories – Sensemaking–Coevolution–Implementation Theory (SCI) and the Function–Behavior–Structure Framework (FBS). Method A survey of more than 1300 software developers is combined with four longitudinal, positivist case studies to achieve a simultaneously broad and deep empirical evaluation. Instrument development, statistical analysis of questionnaire data, case data analysis using a closed-ended, a priori coding scheme and data triangulation are described. Results Case data analysis strongly supports SCI, as does analysis of questionnaire response distributions (p &lt; 0.001; chi-square goodness of fit test). Furthermore, case-questionnaire triangulation found no evidence that support for {SCI} varied by participants’ gender, education, experience, nationality or the size or nature of their projects. Conclusions {SCI} is supported. No evidence of an {FBS} subculture was found. This suggests that instead of iterating between weakly-coupled phases (analysis, design, coding, testing), it is more accurate and useful to conceptualize development as ad hoc oscillation between making sense of the project context (Sensemaking), simultaneously improving mental representations of the context and design space (Coevolution) and constructing, debugging and deploying software artifacts (Implementation).","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:30","2018-02-06 16:58:30","","232 - 250","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Questionnaire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these concerns, during the past few years we have developed methodologies and tools for ontology-enabled traceability; that is, traceability mechanisms where requirements are connected to models of engineering entities by threading the traceability connection through one or more ontologies. In our proof-of-concept work the engineering entities were restricted to elements of system structure. But, of course, real engineering systems also have behaviors. This paper will report on research to understand the role that software patterns (e.g., model-view-controller) and mixtures of graph and tree visualization can play in the implementation of traceability mechanisms from requirements to elements of finite-state machine behavior (e.g., actions, states, transitions and guard conditions). We will present a simple lamp example.","2012","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","214 - 219","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","finite state machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample was made up of 1284 students of Secondary Education, of whom 51.2% are girls and 48.8% are boys, mean age 15.55 years (SD = 1.6). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) guarantee the validity of the scale, with adequate fit indexes and reliability. Likewise, the results of the study confirm that boys, adolescents aged over 15, and those who live in urban areas express significantly more positive attitudes towards sexting, whereas girls show more perception of the risk associated with sending and/or receiving sexts. Boys also send and forward more sexting content than girls.

Only approximate tools have been developed using certain assumptions (like the “independence assumption”) and producing more or less reliable results in practical situations. It is only for the case of a vanishingly small stepsize that such assumptions are not required. There a closed-form solution can be determined for any colouring of the input signal and the additive noise. Here another particular problem is analyzed: the long filter, i.e. a tapped-delay line structure with a large number of taps. For the limiting case of an infinitely long filter, exact closed-form solutions are derived for the steady-state weight-error correlations and the associated “misadjustment”, again valid for any colouring of the input signal and the additive noise, and now also for any stepsize guaranteeing stability. The analysis is based upon a feedback approach, with a forward branch generating the above-mentioned solution for vanishing stepsize and a peculiar feedback branch responsible for higher-order corrections. As in any feedback structure, instability can occur beyond a critical value of the feedback parameter. In our case an experimentally supported maximum stepsize is found, beyond which spontaneous oscillations might occur.","2011-04","2018-02-21 12:52:31","2018-02-21 12:52:31","","690-701","","4","91","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LMS algorithm; Long filter; Misadjustment; Steady-state behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various decision rules can be used to determine the time-varying parameter for combining the filter outputs. A recently proposed scheme based on the ratio of error powers of the two filters has been shown by simulation to achieve nearly optimum performance. The purpose of this paper is to present a first analysis of the statistical behavior of this error power scheme for white Gaussian inputs.

Good performances of this algorithm have been shown for non-Gaussian additive measurement noise. However, the complexity of the algorithm imposes difficulties for the development of a reasonably complete theoretical stochastic model for its behavior. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the development of such a model. We study the stochastic behavior of Least Mean Kurtosis (LMK) algorithm for Gaussian inputs and for additive noises with even probability density functions. Deterministic recursions are derived for the adaptive weight error covariance matrix in a very novel manner, leading to a recursive model for the excess mean square error (EMSE) behavior that is shown to be accurate for Gaussian, uniform and binary noise distributions. The analysis results are then used to compare the performances of LMK with the least mean squares (LMS) and least mean fourth (LMF) algorithms under different circumstances.","2016-07","2018-02-21 12:52:37","2018-02-21 12:52:37","","35-45","","","54","","Digital Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filters; Analysis; LMK algorithm; Stochastic algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such models may be unrealistic for various reasons — a warm-up effect may cause a test taker to respond more slowly than expected to the early items, fatigue may cause a test taker to respond more slowly than expected toward the end of a test, or as time runs out the test taker may quickly guess the answers to the last items on a test. To take these variations in working speed into account, mixture response time models have recently been investigated. Until now, mixture response time models have only been applied for post hoc analyses. This research expands the use of these models by exploring their application in the context of the assembly of individualized computer-based assessments (CBAs). Response time constraints are probabilistic in nature. Stochastic programming was compared to three existing strategies for dealing with probabilistic constraints. Stochastic programming proved to be a very suitable strategy for solving test assembly problems with mixture response time models. Using stochastic programming, computer-based tests could be assembled in such a way that response time information could be used to the fullest extent.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:17","2018-02-06 16:58:17","","693 - 702","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mixture models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Members of {CSDMS} are largely from academic institutions (∼75%), followed by federal agencies (∼17%), and oil and gas companies (∼5%). As an organization that relies on volunteer participation, {CSDMS} faces unique challenges to scientific collaboration. Encouraging volunteerism among its members to provide and adapt metadata and model code to be sufficiently standardized for coupling is crucial to building an integrated community modeling system. {CSDMS} must provide the appropriate technical tools and cyberinfrastructure to support a variety of user types, ranging from advanced to novice modelers. In addition, application of these advances in science is key, both into the educational realm and for managers and decision-makers. We here present data on community contributions and novice user engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of CSDMS’ strategies toward these two challenges over the first 5 years based on member and user data, surveys, computing logs and web log analysis. Analysis shows that sponsored member participation in annual meetings (∼30%) is relatively high. Direct {CSDMS} governance relies on ∼4% of members. About 15% of members contributed code and metadata, and a similar 15% use the common supercomputing resources. Technological development and documentation lie predominantly in hands of the funded members, and a small number of others (∼3% together). Potential new users are trained in clinics and courses, with positive effects on self-efficacy and recruitment of new advanced developers.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:51","2018-02-06 16:58:51","","314 - 321","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Earth surface dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Planning and capturing impact however is a difficult and resource-intensive activity, demanding both strategic commitment and infrastructure support. A means to systematically capture and monitor impact across the organisation is crucial to continued research success. In addition, with impact data capture as an emerging practice, there is the opportunity and necessity for a degree of standardisation in the approach to measuring impact across HEIs. Vertigo Ventures, an impact measurement consultancy, has been using and expanding its tool- VV-Impact Metrics with {UK} universities to support assessments by identifying impact pathways, impact indicators, evidence collection and analysis to improve the quality of the evidence and narrative.

A typical example of behavior-affected processes is the information diffusion by users in generalized networks. In this paper, we focus on user strategy selection with respect to information diffusion in generalized networks, and study its evolutionary dynamics and their benefits, as user behavior/interests change over the course of time. We model information diffusion in generalized networks through graphical evolutionary game theory (graphical EGT) and analyze the evolution of the system and its Evolutionary Stable States (ESS) for time-varying fitness values due to time-varying user interests. We perform extensive evaluations based on numerical and simulation results, and study the impact of several parameters on the derived {ESS} curves (i.e., {ESS} points over time). Such parameters involve user interests and their fitness values, and the degree distributions and network type of the layers of the generalized network. We thoroughly evaluate via numerical analysis and appropriate examples the existence of {ESS} loci for the system dynamics depending on the associated parameters. Also, we discuss the relation between (graphical) EGT-based information diffusion analysis and the epidemics-based information diffusion modeling and analysis that is frequently applied in the literature. Our modeling and evaluations can be used to predict the evolution of the cumulative behavior, allowing for efficient design and control of information campaigns.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:33","2018-02-06 16:57:33","","91 - 103","","","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","social networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we longitudinally investigate a much-debated obligatory full-scale implementation of tablet devices in a large secondary school. We adopt a Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) approach to verify the dynamic nature of students’ acceptance of the tablet as a learning tool at three waves of data collection, both at pre- and short and long-term post-adoption stages. The results clearly indicate the evolutionary nature of the acceptance process, challenging the adequacy of cross-sectional approaches to technology adoption. In the pre-adoption stage, attitude appears as a key uptake factor, whereas three months later, due to practical and technical constraints, the attention shifts to subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Finally, six months after introduction indicative traces of habituation appear, raising concerns on the suitability of the {TPB} in established post-adoption circumstances.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","278 - 286","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only mining the user׳s behavior in order to provide better content is popular, but the prediction of the user׳s behavior is interesting and can increase user experience. Moreover, the business clearly desires such information to improve their services. In this paper we focus to the education domain as it belongs to the most dynamically transforming areas. Web based e-learning systems are nowadays reaching still greater popularity, because of possibilities they offer to students. We analyze various sources of “e-students” feedback and discuss today׳s challenges from the logging and feedback collecting point of view. Next, we focus on the prediction of student׳s next action within an e-learning application (in the mean of “stay or leave?” question). Such information can improve students׳ attrition rate by introducing various personalized approaches. We proposed the classifier based on polynomial regression and stochastic gradient descent to learn the attributes importance. In this way we are able to process a stream of data in one single iteration and thus we are able to reflect dynamic users׳ behavior changes. Our experiments are based on the log data collected from our web-based education system {ALEF} during three-year period. We found that there is an extensive heterogeneity in the users׳ (student) behavior which we were able to handle by using individual weights calculated for every user.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:36","2018-02-06 16:57:36","","136 - 149","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stochastic gradient descent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Teachers can play pivotal roles in fostering students' evaluation of digital information. Here, using Norwegian data drawn from 1158 teachers in 116 schools, we report on an investigation into ways in which variables interact and influence such fostering. Overall, most teachers are found to report that student skills in evaluating digital information are a focus of instruction, especially in respect of the evaluation of accuracy, credibility and relevance. In addition, the results show moderate to high positive associations among the use of information communication and technology (ICT) in teaching generally, {ICT} self-efficacy for instructional purposes, collegial collaborations and the teacher fostering (of students' capabilities to evaluate digital information). Finally, a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that the use of {ICT} in teaching and {ICT} self-efficacy for instructional purposes are positive predictors of variations in teaching practices related to fostering students’ abilities to evaluate digital information.","2018","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","56 - 63","","","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norwegian teachers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about how different students experience and are engaged by it. We present a long-term study which identified distinct behavioral and performance patterns in participants taking a gamified college course. Our study lasted for three years, during which we deployed three consecutive instances of the course, each featuring improvements based on student feedback from the previous instances. To understand how different students behaved in our gamified experience, according to their daily performance, we performed cluster analysis and assessed student engagement in the last year using a formal instrument. We then did a cluster-wise analysis using different performance and behavioral measures, to further assess and characterize every cluster. To wit, we identified six different student clusters, each featuring different behaviors and performance levels. However, only four were present in the last year, which differed in terms of engagement with the course. In this paper we carefully describe each student cluster, explain how they evolved, and derive meaningful design lessons.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","550 - 585","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","student performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research is focused on educational/instructional design for students' learning. In this sub-field, progress has been more limited. In particular, neither research nor systems development have paid much attention to the fact that design is becoming a more collaborative endeavor. This paper reports the latest research outcomes from R&amp;D in the Educational Design Studio (EDS), a facility developed iteratively over four years to support and understand collaborative, real-time, co-present design work. The {EDS} serves to (i) enhance our scientific understanding of design processes and design cognition and (ii) provide insights into how designers' work can be improved through appropriate technological support. In the study presented here, we introduced a complex, multi-user, digital design tool into the existing ecology of tools and resources available in the EDS. We analysed the activity of four pairs of ‘teacher-designers’ during a design task. We identified different behaviors - in reconfiguring the task, the working methods and toolset usage. Our data provide new insights about the affordances of different digital and analogue design surfaces used in the Studio.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:08","2018-02-06 16:57:08","","327 - 342","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","teaching/learning strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We here extend this approach to Synthetic Event-Related Potentials (Synthetic ERP). Although the method is of general applicability, we focus on {ERP} correlates of language processing in the human brain. The method has two components: Phase 1: To generate cortical electro-magnetic source activity from neural or schema network models; and Phase 2: To generate known neurolinguistic {ERP} data (ERP scalp voltage topographies and waveforms) from putative cortical source distributions and activities within a realistic anatomical model of the human brain and head. To illustrate the challenges of Phase 2 of the methodology, spatiotemporal information from Friederici’s 2002 model of auditory language comprehension was used to define cortical regions and time courses of activation for implementation within a forward model of {ERP} data. The cortical regions from the 2002 model were modeled using atlas-based masks overlaid on the {MNI} high definition single subject cortical mesh. The electromagnetic contribution of each region was modeled using current dipoles whose position and orientation were constrained by the cortical geometry. In linking neural network computation via {EEG} forward modeling to empirical results in neurolinguistics, we emphasize the need for neural network models to link their architecture to geometrically sound models of the cortical surface, and the need for conceptual models to refine and adopt brain-atlas based approaches to allow precise brain anchoring of their modules. The detailed analysis of Phase 2 sets the stage for a brief introduction to Phase 1 of the program, including the case for a schema-theoretic approach to language production and perception presented in detail elsewhere. Unlike Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and Bojak’s mean field model, Synthetic {ERP} builds on models of networks that mediate the relation between the brain’s inputs, outputs, and internal states in executing a specific task. The neural networks used for Synthetic {ERP} must include neuroanatomically realistic placement and orientation of the cortical pyramidal neurons. These constraints pose exciting challenges for future work in neural network modeling that is applicable to systems and cognitive neuroscience.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:13","2018-02-06 16:59:13","","66 - 92","","","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel scientific monitoring device for automated measurement of ruminating and eating behavior in stable-fed cows to provide research with a measuring instrument for automated health and activity monitoring. The RumiWatch noseband sensor (Itin+Hoch GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland) incorporates a noseband pressure sensor, a data logger with online data analysis, and software. Automated measurements of behavioral parameters are based on generic algorithms without animal-specific learning data. Thereby, the system records and classifies the duration of chewing activities and enables users to quantify individual ruminating and eating jaw movements performed by the animal. During the course of the development, two releases of the system-specific software RumiWatch Converter (RWC) were created and taken into account for the validation study. The results generated by the two software versions, {RWC} V0.7.2.0 and {RWC} V0.7.3.2, were compared with direct behavioral observations. Direct observations of cow behavior were conducted on 14 Swiss dairy farms with an observation time of 1 h per animal, resulting in a total sample of 60 dairy cows. Agreement of sensor measurement and direct observation was expressed as Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) for the pooled sample. For consolidated classification of sensor data (1-h resolution), correlations for rumination time were rs = 0.91 (RWC V0.7.2.0) and rs = 0.96 (RWC 0.7.3.2), and for eating time rs = 0.86 (RWC 0.7.2.0) and rs = 0.96 (RWC V0.7.3.2). Both software versions provide a high standard of validity and measuring performance for ruminating and eating behavior. The high to very high correlations between direct observation and sensor data demonstrate that the RumiWatch noseband sensor was successfully developed and validated as a scientific monitoring device for automated measurement of ruminating and eating activity in stable-fed dairy cows.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:44","2018-02-06 16:58:44","","31 - 41","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chewing activity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research has investigated the impact of forum reading and posting, as well as access to reading resources, on academic performance. However, little is known about the relationship between the temporal frequency of these activities and individual student’s performance. In addition, some studies have proposed different categorizations of student activities, and proved the usefulness of these characterizations for predictive purposes and better understanding of the learning process. One of the biggest concerns when teaching courses in a virtual learning environment is to create and develop instruction in a way that it improves the overall learning experience and results. The present study addresses this concern by drawing upon factors influencing academic performance; more specifically, the study focuses on objective factors related to the interaction between the student and the system (number of resources visited in the learning platform, and number of forum posts and views). On top of that, a visualization tool was designed and implemented to allow for further investigation of the relevance of the study variables. The results from the study show that there is a recurrent pattern in the frequency of behaviors and performance across different courses.","2015","2018-02-06 16:56:38","2018-02-21 13:57:24","","60 - 67","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic performance; eLearning; Learning analytics; Online interaction indicators; Visualization; visualization; Visual learning analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a growing interest in studying the role of the teacher during CSCL. This study aims to contribute to the conceptualization of teacher interventions during CSCL. A teacher and his class worked in a {CSCL} environment for 8 lessons. Focus and means of teacher interventions were analyzed across these 8 time points. The results show that the teacher’s behavior varied greatly between lessons and also between groups, which contradicts research that has aggregated teacher behavior to types or teaching styles. Findings consistent across time points include the predominance of the teacher’s focus on students’ cognitive rather than social activities, and a higher number of interventions in groups where student activity was higher. Suggestions are made for future research, which include studying the effectiveness of supporting tools for teachers.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","1377 - 1386","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","temporality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, a key challenge has been that physicians in rural and remote locations, or physicians who are time challenged, have limited ability to participate in face-to-face meetings with academic detailers, as these specially trained academic detailers are primarily urban-based and limited in numbers. Objective To determine the feasibility of using information technologies to facilitate communication between academic detailers and physicians (known as Technology-Enabled Academic Detailing or TEAD) through a comparison to traditional face-to-face academic detailing (AD). Specifically, {TEAD} is compared to {AD} in terms of the ability to aid physicians in acquiring evidence-informed prescribing information on diabetes-related medications, measured in terms of time efficiency, satisfaction of both physicians and pharmacists, and quality of knowledge exchange. Methods General Practitioner Physicians (n = 105) and pharmacists (n = 12) were recruited from across British Columbia. Pharmacists were trained to be academic detailers on diabetes medication usage. Physicians were assigned to one of four intervention groups to receive four academic detailing sessions from trained pharmacists. Intervention groups included: (1) {AD} only, (2) {TEAD} only, (3) {TEAD} crossed over to {AD} at midpoint, and (4) {AD} crossed over to {TEAD} at midpoint. Evaluation included physician-completed surveys before and after each session, pharmacist logs after each detailing session, interviews and focus groups with physicians and pharmacists at study completion, as well as a technical support log to record all phone calls and emails from physicians and pharmacists regarding any technical challenges during the {TEAD} sessions, or usage of the web portal. Results Because recruitment was very low for the cross over groups, we analyzed the results in two groups instead: {AD} only and {TEAD} only. 354 sessions were conducted (AD = 161, {TEAD} = 193). Of these, complete data were available for 300 sessions, which were included in analysis (AD = 133, {TEAD} = 167). On average, {TEAD} sessions were 49 min long, and {AD} sessions 81 min long. Overall, physicians enjoyed both modalities of academic detailing (AD and TEAD) because they received information that both reinforced their existing diabetes knowledge and also provided new prescribing insights and approaches. Conclusion The results suggest that {TEAD} is an acceptable alternative to {AD} for providing physicians advice about prescribing. {TEAD} is more time efficient, facilitates effective knowledge exchange and interprofessional collaboration, and can reach those physicians virtually where face-to-face {AD} is not possible or practical. Limitations Due to logistics, physicians were allocated, rather than randomized, to receive {AD} and/or TEAD.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","762 - 771","","9","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic detailing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success or failure of initiatives in support of this quest are often understood in terms of an adversarial dynamic or struggle between the professional logics of medicine and of management. Here, we use the case of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) to a well-established ritual of medical autonomy (the medical ward round) to articulate a more nuanced explanation of how and why new ways of working with technology are accepted and adopted (or not). Methods The study was conducted across four intensive care units (ICUs) in major teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Using interviews, we examined 48 doctors’ perceptions of the impact of {ICT} on ward round practice. We applied the concept of institutional logics to frame our analysis. Interview transcripts were analysed using a hybrid of deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Results The doctors displayed a complex engagement with the technology that belies simplistic characterisations of medical rejection of managerial encroachment. In fact, they selectively welcomed into the ward round aspects of the technology which reinforced the doctor’s place in the healthcare hierarchy and which augmented their role as scientists. At the same time, they guarded against allowing managerial logic embedded in {ICT} to de-emphasise their embodied subjectivity in relation to the patient as a person rather than as a collection of parameters. Conclusion {ICT} can force the disruption of some aspects of existing routines, even where these are long-established rituals. Resistance arose when the new technology did not fit with the ‘logic of care’. Incorporation of the logic of care into the design and customisation of clinical information systems is a challenge and potentially counterproductive, because it could attempt to apply a technological fix to what is essentially a social problem. However, there are significant opportunities to ensure that new technologies do not obstruct doctors’ roles as carers nor disrupt the embodied relationship they need to have with patients.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-06 16:58:06","","49 - 58","","","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Work practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high attrition rates associated with {MOOCs} have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with {MOOCs} and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.","2016","2018-02-06 16:56:36","2018-02-21 13:57:28","","119 - 129","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algorithm; Dropout; learning analytics; Learning analytics; MOOC; Prediction; Stacking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To use the technology, nurses are required to login to an electronic health record, scan a medication and a form of patient identification to ensure that these correspond correctly with the ordered medications prior to medication administration. In acute care settings, patient wristbands have been traditionally used as a form of identification; however, past research has suggested that this method of identification may not be preferred in inpatient mental health settings. If barcode medication administration technology is to be effectively used in this context, healthcare organizations need to understand patient preferences with regards to identification methods. Purpose The purpose of this study was to elicit patient perceptions of barcode medication administration identification practices in inpatient mental health settings. Insights gathered can be used to determine patient-centered preferences of identifying patients using barcode medication administration technology. Methods Using a qualitative descriptive approach, fifty-two (n = 52) inpatient interviews were completed by a Peer Support Worker using a semi-structured interview guide over a period of two months. Interviews were conducted in a number of inpatient mental health areas including forensic, youth, geriatric, acute, and rehabilitation services. An interprofessional team, inclusive of a Peer Support Worker, completed a thematic analysis of the interview data. Results Six themes emerged as a result of the inductive data analysis. These included: management of information, privacy and security, stigma, relationships, safety and comfort, and negative associations with the technology. Patients also indicated that they would like a choice in the type of identification method used during barcode medication administration. As well, suggestions were made for how barcode medication administration practices could be modified to become more patient-centered. Conclusion The results of this study have a number of implications for healthcare organizations. As patients indicated that they would like a choice in the type of identification method used during barcode medication administration, healthcare organizations will need to determine how they can facilitate this process. Furthermore, many of the concerns that patients had with barcode medication administration technology could be addressed through patient education.","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","31 - 37","","","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This scenario encourages manufacturing companies to invest in new and more integrated monitoring and control solutions in order to optimize more and more their production processes to enable a faster fault detection, reducing down-times during production while improving system performances and throughput along time. In accordance with these needs, the research done under the scope of Self-Learning Production Systems (SLPS) tries to enhance the control together with other manufacturing activities (e.g. energy saving, maintenance, lifecycle optimization, etc.). The key assumption is that the integration of context awareness and data mining techniques with traditional monitoring and control solutions will reduce maintenance problems, production line downtimes and manufacturing operational costs while guaranteeing a more efficient management of the manufacturing resources.","2015","2018-02-06 16:59:06","2018-02-06 16:59:06","","25 - 35","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SOA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The more they believe their behaviour has something to do with what happens to them the more internal they are. In contrast the more they perceive that what happens to them is beyond their control and determined by luck, fate, chance or powerful others the more external they are. Copious research findings suggest that external {LOC} (ELOC) is associated with many adverse personal, social, academic and health outcomes. In spite of its importance in so many areas of human behaviour relatively little is known about the features of the early background of individuals that contributes to these expectancies. This is the first in a number of studies that will suggest possible antecedents and consequences of having a high ELOC. The study takes advantage of the data collected in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which started by studying pregnancies in 1991–1992 of residents in an area of south-west England. Over 12000 of the women who enrolled during pregnancy completed a set of questions in mid-pregnancy from which an {LOC} score was computed. {ELOC} was defined as a score greater than the median. The relationships with characteristics of the women’s parents and her early childhood (&lt;6 years) are considered first as unadjusted odds ratios and then as adjusted after analysis using hierarchical sets of stepwise logistic regressions. The relative contributions to the women’s {ELOC} was measured using a goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure. The analyses demonstrated the independent importance of maternal and paternal backgrounds as well as features of her early childhood (&lt;6 years). The final model identified nine independent features (each with P &lt; 0.0001): year of birth of her mother, maternal and paternal education levels, father smoked, mother smoked when pregnant, year of birth of study woman, the number of older siblings she had, whether her father was absent during this period, and whether she spent her childhood in the study area. In conclusion, the woman’s {LOC} appears to be independently influenced by a number of characteristics which may give clues as to possible mechanisms—and how internality may be supported in the future. Subsequent papers will assess both whether features of later childhood influence the woman’s {LOC} and whether the {LOC} of men in the study have similar antecedents.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","e00236","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model building also enhanced creative thinking and helped students become more aware of their own meta-cognitive design strategies.

The safety of pregnant women raises public concern and there is a need to identify ways to prevent potential adverse events to the pregnant woman. This study used a health smart card with a clinical reminder system to keep continuous records of general outpatient visits of pregnant women to protect them from potential adverse events caused by improper prescription. Method The health smart card, issued to all 23 million citizens in Taiwan, was used to work with a Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) implemented at a 700-bed teaching medical center in Taipei to provide the outpatient information of pregnant women. {FDA} pregnancy risk classification was used to categorize the risk of pregnant women. The log file, combined with the physicians’ and patients’ profiles, were statistically examined using the Mantel–Haenszel technique to evaluate the impact of system in changing physician's prescription behavior. Results A total of 441 patients ranged in age from 15 to 50 years with 1114 prescriptions involved in {FDA} pregnancy risk classification C, D, and X during the study period. 144 reminders (13.1%) were accepted by physicians for further assessment and 100 (69.4%) of them were modified. Non-obstetric physicians in non-emergency setting were more intended to accept reminders (27.8%, 4.9 folds than obstetricians). Reminders triggered on patients in second trimester (15.5%) were accepted by all physicians more than third trimester (OR 1.52, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion A health smart card armed with {CPOE} reminder system and well-defined criteria had the potential to decrease harmful medication prescribed to pregnant patients. The results show better conformance for non-obstetric physicians (26%) and when physicians accepted the alerts they are more likely to went back and review their orders (69%). In sum, reminder criteria of {FDA} pregnancy risk classification C for obstetricians and reminder based on different trimesters is suggested to be refined to improve system acceptability and to decrease improper prescription.","2012","2018-02-06 16:58:54","2018-02-06 16:58:54","","605 - 611","","9","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pregnancy safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interactive test consisted of scenarios describing stressful situations that could occur in college students’ everyday lives. Furthermore, college students could relate the concerns raised by these hypothetical situations to the ways they manage their stress and mental health. After the student’s choice behavior in each scenario, a virtual agent conveyed health-related educational messages via a text-modal dialogue box. Participants who took the interactive test in which there was a virtual agent perceived the test as more educational and entertaining than those who took the test without a virtual agent. Results of a path analysis also revealed a significant mediating role of enjoyment on educational outcomes (i.e., students’ enjoyment of the interactive test mediated the effects of the presence of a virtual agent on their perceived educational value of health information), thus confirming the Entertainment–Education link. In addition, engaging in the interactive test resulted in stress management self-efficacy improvement.

A quantitative methodology approach was adopted in this study. To test the hypothesized research model, data was collected from 569 undergraduate and postgraduate students studying in Lebanon via questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique based on {AMOS} methods in conjunction with multi-group analysis. The result revealed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), subjective norms (SN) and Quality of Work Life (QWL) positively affect students’ behavioural intention (BI). We also found that experience moderates the relationship between PEOU, {PU} and {SN} on e-learning use intention, and that age difference moderates the effects of PEOU, {SN} and {QWL} on BI. In addition, educational level moderates the effects of PEOU, {SN} on BI, and gender moderates the effects of PU, {SN} and {QWL} on BI. Contrary to expectations, a moderating role of age on the relationship between {PU} and {BI} was not found. Similarly, gender was not found to affect the relationship between {PEOU} and BI, and educational level did not moderate the relationship between {PU} or {QWL} and BI. In light of these findings, implications to both theory and practice are discussed.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","153 - 163","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","developing countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For treatment A, students were given an annotation tool in addition to a checklist (Control A). For treatment B, instead of persuasion goal instructions (Control B), written task directions prompted student to consider alternative ideas (balanced reasoning goals). We measured students' {IEB} four times. We also measured individual task perception and cognitive capacity. Multilevel analyses identified the specific nature of changes in IEB. On average, {IEB} did not improve much in the baseline group while task perception and cognitive capacity differentiated {IEB} scores. Conversely, both annotation and balanced reasoning goals yielded improved gains in IEB, but there was a negative interaction effect when they were combined. The results demonstrate the benefits of annotation and balanced reasoning goals but suggest the need to address possible difficulties in using multiple scaffolds.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","384 - 397","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Goal instructions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method An audience response system called {SIDRA} was integrated with a neural network-based data analysis to generate diagnostic feedback for guided learning. A total of 200 medical students enrolled in a General and Descriptive Anatomy of the Locomotor System course were taught using two different methods. Ninety students in the experimental group used intelligent {SIDRA} (i-SIDRA), whereas 110 students in the control group received the same training but without employing i-SIDRA. Results In the students’ final exam grades, a statistically significant difference was found between those students that used i-SIDRA as opposed to a traditional teaching methodology (T(162) = 2.597; p = 0.010). The increase in the number of correct answers during the feedback guided learning process from the first submission to the last submission in four multiple choice question tests was also analyzed. There were average increases of 20.00% (Test1), 11.34% (Test2), 8.88% (Test3) and 13.43% (Test4) in the number of correct answers. In a questionnaire rated on a five-point Likert-type scale, the students expressed satisfaction with the content (M = 4.2) and feedback (M = 3.5) provided by i-SIDRA and the methodology (M = 4.2) used to learn anatomy. Conclusions The use of audience response systems enriched with feedback such as i-SIDRA improves medical degree students’ performance as regards anatomy of the locomotor system. The knowledge state diagrams representing students’ behavior allow instructors to study their progress so as to identify what they still need to learn.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:06","2018-02-06 16:58:06","","172 - 181","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","experiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Customer relationship management (CRM) is an important concept to maintain competitiveness at e-commerce. The issue of electronic customer relationship management (E-CRM) has increasingly become the identification of the success of the {CRM} implementation. The E-CRM has emerged as one of the most prominent information system that enables organizations to contact customers and collect, store and analyze customer data in order to provide a comprehensive view of their customers. Organization can obtain competitive advantages from increase effectiveness of the E-CRM. This research proposes determining the effective factors (cost, technology acceptance and employees' satisfaction) for the effectiveness of the E-CRM. The structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model and to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model. The results of gathered data from 210 employees of the East Azerbaijan Tax Administration in iran is indicated that the impact of the technology acceptance on organization performance begins with infrastructure capability, ease of use, and E-learning systems, and the complementarity between these factors positively influences the effectiveness of the E-CRM. The results also indicated that the customer costs positively affects on the customer relationship performance, which consequently leads to improvements of the effectiveness of the E-CRM in organization. Our findings show that each of cost, technology acceptance and satisfaction employee plays an important role toward in effectiveness of the E-CRM.","2016","2018-02-06 16:59:14","2018-02-06 16:59:14","","1052 - 1066","","","55, Part B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although learning design is widely studied, often these studies are individual courses or programmes and few empirical studies have connected learning designs of a substantial number of courses with learning behaviour. In this study we linked 151 modules and 111.256 students with students' behaviour (&lt;400 million minutes of online behaviour), satisfaction and performance at the Open University {UK} using multiple regression models. Our findings strongly indicate the importance of learning design in predicting and understanding Virtual Learning Environment behaviour and performance of students in blended and online environments. In line with proponents of social learning theories, our primary predictor for academic retention was the time learners spent on communication activities, controlling for various institutional and disciplinary factors. Where possible, appropriate and well designed communication tasks that align with the learning objectives of the course may be a way forward to enhance academic retention.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-21 13:57:34","","333 - 341","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic retention; Learner satisfaction; Learning analytics; Learning design; virtual learning environment; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-three students in a large undergraduate course on educational psychology were assigned one of two summarizing roles (Synthesizer, Wrapper) on a rotating basis during six week-long small-group online discussions; demographic and log-file data were collected (N = 198 student-weeks). Multilevel, cross-classification modeling revealed that assigning students summarizing roles increased the breadth of their listening during in-role weeks, but the effect was only weakly sustained after the role was completed. Students taking the Synthesizer role showed some increased depth of listening during in-role weeks but not post-role weeks. Other post-role behavior changes (a reduced number of sessions and review of posts) suggest unintended negative side effects of a role-rotation strategy, possibly due to post-role abdication of responsibility.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","261 - 271","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Temporal analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study proposed and empirically examined a conceptual model that aimed to fill this gap. The main purpose is to present an extensive empirical data of 305 novice or expert students (153 graduates and 152 postgraduates) who enrolled in online courses at university level which were held in Second Life. On this occasion it was tried to be investigated, measured and finally verified the effects of computer self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation and self-esteem that can predict the students’ engagement as an overall multidimensional construct of factors (cognitive, emotional and behavioral). The results from the three-step hierarchical regression analysis revealed that computer self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation, and self-esteem in online courses were not only positively correlated with student’s cognitive and emotional engagement factors, but were also negatively correlated with behavioral factors. Educational implications from these results can provide a more expedient and meritorious instructional quality format aimed at reinforcing users’ engagement in Second Life for sequencing and pacing future-driven online courses.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","157 - 170","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Self-esteem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many factors affecting behavioural intention to use {ICT} in knowledge sharing either from individual, organizational or technological perspectives. In studying knowledge sharing, many previous researchers combined the psychological and knowledge sharing theories to develop theoretical models. Thus, based on several theories, this paper seeks to examine the organizational factors that contribute to successful knowledge sharing using {ICT} among teachers. The results can provide information to the Government in providing the infrastructure, activities or programmes as well as the system of rewards and recognition that can increase the use of {ICT} in knowledge sharing and to enhance the profession of teaching. A mix method was employed to achieve the objectives. A survey was conducted in 20 selected schools in Perak from November 2011 to January 2012. The questionnaires, as the instrument for data collection, were distributed to 400 respondents. The data was analyzed using Structural equation modelling using {AMOS} version 19.0.

Also the gender effect on the researched variables are concerned. The participants in the study were 434 university students who had experience using the Internet. The Internet self-efficacy scale (translated and modified based on Kim &amp; Glassman scale, 2013), the self-designed anti-phishing self-efficacy scale, and the self-designed anti-phishing behavior scale were used in this study. This study used convenience sampling to conduct the survey, which resulted in 411 valid responses. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling are adopted to test the mediation effect. The results showed statistically significant differences in anti-phishing behavior and anti-phishing self-efficacy between female and male university students. The {SEM} analysis showed that Internet self-efficacy is a positive precedent to anti-phishing behavior, and anti-phishing self-efficacy significantly mediated the relation between Internet self-efficacy and anti-phishing behavior. This study suggests that educators could use strategies to improve Internet self-efficacy and anti-phishing self-efficacy in order to enhance learners’ motivation and experience with anti-phishing. The Internet self-efficacy scale and the anti-phishing self-efficacy scale may be used as a reference for adaptive teaching materials.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:34","2018-02-06 16:57:34","","249 - 257","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anti-phishing behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technology acceptance model (TAM) with its constituent variables such as perceived usefulness (PUSS) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) was the theoretical framework used for this study. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada. Usable data was collected from 197 registered nurses (RNs). Relevant hypotheses were formulated and the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used for data analysis. Results The results of the hypothesized relationships showed that education and computer knowledge have positive moderating effects on the influences of {PEOU} and {PUSS} on nurses’ attitudes toward {IS} (ATTI). The factors of nurses’ years of nursing experience and age did not yield meaningful results. {ATTI} impacted behavioral intentions to use IS, which positively impacted nurses’ use of IS. The nurses sampled in the study have positive {IS} use behaviors. Conclusions This study demonstrates that relevant demographic factors and individual characteristics, if incorporated into frameworks used for investigating nurses’ acceptance of IS, could permit the emergence of useful insights for practitioners and researchers. Specifically, this study showed that nurses with higher educational attainments and more basic computer knowledge readily accept implemented {IS} at work. Hospital administrators benefit from insights such as the one presented in this study.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:49","2018-02-06 16:58:49","","27 - 35","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Demographic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two types of cyber-interpersonal violence are examined: Cyber-harassment (including cyber-sexual harassment) and cyber-impersonation. Using Choi's (2008) integrated theory of Cyber-Routine Activities Theory, a sample of 272 college students at a Massachusetts university are examined. Three major findings are revealed: (1) Respondents who engage in risky online leisure activities are more likely to experience interpersonal violence in cyberspace, (2) poor online security management can contribute to the likelihood of being victimized by interpersonal violence on social networking sites (SNS), and (3) respondents who engage in risky social networking site activities are likely to commit cyber-interpersonal violence. For the two types of cyber-interpersonal violence examined in this study, it could also be predicted that females are more likely to have higher levels of victimization. Cybersecurity management and sex had no significant effects on cyber-interpersonal violence offending. The hope is that education on the potential hazards of the Internet and of cyber-interpersonal violence will induce more responsible online activity and engagement.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:43","2018-02-06 16:58:43","","394 - 402","","","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Victim-offender overlap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of adaptive feedback cancellers has been studied by assuming that the feedback path can be modeled as a linear system. However, limited dynamic range, low-cost loudspeakers, and nonlinear power amplifiers may distort the hearing aid output signal. In this way, linear-based predictions of the canceller performance may lead to significant deviations from its actual behavior. This work presents a theoretical performance analysis of a Least Mean Square based shadow filter that is applied to set up the coefficients of a feedback canceller, which is subject to a static saturation type nonlinearity at the output of the direct path. Deterministic recursive equations are derived to predict the mean square feedback error and the mean coefficient vector evolution between updates of the feedback canceller. These models are defined as functions of the canceller parameters and input signal statistics. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations show the provided models are highly accurate under the considered assumptions. The developed models allow inferences about the potential impact of an overdriven loudspeaker over the transient performance of the direct method feedback canceller, serving as insightful tools for understanding the involved mechanisms.","2017-12-01","2018-02-21 12:52:43","2018-02-21 12:52:43","","243-254","","","91","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filter; Clipping; Feedback canceller; Hearing aids; Nonlinearity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we resolve this problem by developing a novel variant of the LMS algorithms based on the q-derivative concept. The q-gradient is an extension of the classical gradient vector based on the concept of Jackson׳s derivative. Here, we propose to minimize the LMS cost function by employing the concept of q-derivative instead of the convent ional derivative. Thanks to the fact that the q-derivative takes larger steps in the search direction as it evaluates the secant of the cost function rather than the tangent (as in the case of a conventional derivative), we show that the q-derivative gives faster convergence for q &gt; 1 when compared to the conventional derivative. Then, we present a thorough investigation of the convergence behavior of the proposed q-LMS algorithm and carry out different analyses to assess its performance. Consequently, new explicit closed-form expressions for the mean-square-error (MSE) behavior are derived. Simulation results are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings.","2015-06","2018-02-21 12:52:30","2018-02-21 12:52:30","","50-60","","","111","","Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive filters; LMS algorithm; q-gradient; q-LMS algorithm; Steady-state analysis; Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have limited knowledge, however, about the fundamental components of therapist guidance in ICBT. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine therapist messages sent to patients during the course of {ICBT} for depressive symptoms in order to identify common “therapist behaviours” and the extent to which these behaviours correlate with completion of modules and improvements in symptoms at post-treatment, one- and two-year follow-up. A total of 664 e-mails from 5 therapists to 42 patients were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The most frequent behaviour was encouraging that accounted for 31.5% of the total number of coded behaviours. This was followed by affirming (25.1%), guiding (22.2%) and urging (9.8%). Less frequently the therapists clarified the internet treatment framework, informed about module content, emphasised the importance of patient responsibility, confronted the patient and made self-disclosures. Six of the nine identified therapist behaviours correlated with module completion. Three behaviours correlated with symptom improvement. Affirming correlated significantly (r = .42, p = .005) with improvement in depressive symptoms at post-treatment and after two years (r = .39, p = .014). Encouraging was associated with outcome directly after treatment (r = .52, p = .001). Self-disclosure was correlated with improvement in depressive symptoms at post-treatment (r = .44, p = .003). The study contributes to a better understanding of therapist behaviours in {ICBT} for depressive symptoms. Future directions for research are discussed.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-06 16:57:18","","1 - 7","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Patient adherence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Pew Center’s Internet and American Life Project suggests that college students are the most rapid adopters of cell phone technology and research is emerging which suggests high frequency cell phone use may be influencing their health and behavior. Thus, we investigated the relationships between total cell phone use (N = 496) and texting (N = 490) on Satisfaction with Life (SWL) in a large sample of college students. It was hypothesized that the relationship would be mediated by Academic Performance (GPA) and anxiety. Two separate path models indicated that the cell phone use and texting models had good overall fit. Cell phone use/texting was negatively related to {GPA} and positively related to anxiety; in turn, {GPA} was positively related to {SWL} while anxiety was negatively related to SWL. These findings add to the debate about student cell phone use, and how increased use may negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and subjective well-being or happiness.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","343 - 350","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Post-secondary education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose the ‘Action-based Learning Assessment Method’ (ALAM) using an action taxonomy to classify recognized actions performed by the user in the virtual world. Most of these taxonomies were developed to model the behavior and performance of users. Yet, current taxonomies of human actions were developed based on need in specific research, still lacking a general taxonomy. The taxonomy of goal-oriented actions in virtual training environments was developed to overcome this problem and will be discussed in this paper.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-21 12:00:26","","38 - 46","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Action-based Learning Assessment; Human actions; Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, insights generated by these predictive models may not be suitable for pedagogically informed interventions due to the inability to explain why students display these behavioral patterns. Therefore, this study aims at providing explanations of students' behaviors on LMS by incorporating dispositional dimensions (e.g., self-regulation and emotions) into conventional learning analytics models. Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom. Our results highlight the need to move beyond simple engagement metrics, whereby dispositional learning analytics provide an actionable bridge between learning analytics and educational intervention.","2017-03-01","2018-02-21 12:59:15","2018-02-21 12:59:15","","6-16","","1","10","","IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","actionable learning analytics; Context; educational intervention; Instruments; LA; learning dispositions; learning management system; Learning management systems; learning management systems; LMS; Mathematics; pedagogically informed interventions; predictive models; Predictive models; Silicon; social-cognitive theories; student behavior; Technology enhanced learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OntoPersonaURM is composed of three interrelated ontologies: Persona Ontology, Behavioral-GST (Behavioral-Goal-Scenario-Task) Ontology, and Requirements Ontology. The objectives are to examine 1) how the concept of persona, in the context of the concepts of viewpoint, goal, scenario, task, and requirement, may be integrated in a unified environment and 2) how the concepts and their relationships may be specified ontologically. The explicit specifications of concepts and their relationships in the developed ontologies serve to establish a knowledge repository and foster common understanding of users’ needs and behaviors among developers and stakeholders during the requirements analysis and modeling activity. We provide a running example of a university course registration web application domain to demonstrate the OntoPersonaURM model, consisting of {UML} class diagrams and explicit specifications of the concepts of the ontologies in the Protégé-Frames ontology knowledge management environment.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:02","2018-02-06 16:59:02","","314 - 321","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Concept Development Process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through this approach, we show how textual reporting is a coherent way of providing information that can complement (and even enhance) visual statistics and help teachers to understand in a comprehensible manner the behavior of their students during the course. This solution extracts relevant information from the students' activity and encodes it into intermediate descriptions using linguistic variables and temporal references, which are subsequently translated into texts in natural language.

It is necessary to transform these data into useful business analytics that allow a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the e-service, the various types of value it generates, and its whole value generation mechanism, and at the same time provide guidance for its improvement and optimization. We propose and validate a methodology for transforming user evaluation data into useful business analytics, founded on the technology acceptance model, the {IS} success model and e-services. We define a three-layer value model for e-services, including concerning its efficiency, effectiveness and impact on users’ future behavior respectively. This value model is used for collecting and processing service evaluation data from users. We calculated two classes of business analytics: average users’ ratings to identify strengths and weaknesses of e-services; and the impacts of first- layer value measures on the second and third layer value ones. The latter allows a better understanding of the value generation mechanism for e-services and identification of improvement priorities. Our methodology has been applied and validated for an e-learning service provided by a university to technology professionals.","2012","2018-02-06 16:57:43","2018-02-06 16:57:43","","129 - 141","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many different types of complications can occur during the course of treatment, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and necessitating unscheduled visits and hospitalisations. Follow-up becomes a multidisciplinary process, involving the transplantation centre, the nephrology department which provided care before transplantation, the family physician, and an increasing number of other healthcare professionals, such as nurses, dieticians, psychologists, biologists and pharmacists; the process requires the establishment of efficient communication tools. Methods Transplantelic was developed to meet the need for a permanent communication hub. Designed as an integral part of a patient-oriented educational program, Transplantelic is composed of an electronic medical record where healthcare professionals and patients can share information. Several interfaces are available, e.g. with the “physician” interface clinicians can consult and update the patient's electronic file or share pertinent information. With the “biology” interface, laboratory results are automatically fed into the patient's file. A “pharmacy” interface is under development. Rapid and direct communication is enabled by a secure messaging system. To resolve the problem resulting from the very large amount of information generated by data collection systems, which rapidly exceed the analytical capacities of a single individual, an expert alert system provides a sophisticated diagnostic guide based on mathematical models designed in cooperation with Lorraine Research Laboratory in Computer Science and its Applications (LORIA). Results Transplantelic system monitoring via telemedicine of renal transplant patients is a useful system for the patients and their care. It allows them to acquire autonomy while having a sense of security. However, our analysis shows that in terms of operating, facilities must be made to make the system more efficient over time. Nephrologists should be more involved in the project and other caregivers should be involved. Conclusion The positive impact of the system – in terms of clinical improvement (health status), behaviour (adherence, management practices, etc.), institutional involvement (use of healthcare services), and financial expenditures – remains to be explored.","2013","2018-02-06 16:59:02","2018-02-06 16:59:02","","5 - 10","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kidney transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research we argue that different types of uncertainty are associated with the information seeking process and that, with the proliferation of new and different search tools, sources and channels, uncertainty, positive/desirable or negative/undesirable, continues to be a significant factor in the search process. Users may feel uncertain at any stage of the information search and retrieval process and uncertainty may remain even after completion of the process resulting in what may be called persistent uncertainty. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from users in the higher education sector. There were three parts to the questionnaire focusing on: information seeking activities, information seeking problems, and access to specific information channels or sources. Quantitative analysis was carried out on the data collected through the online questionnaire. A total of 668 responses were returned from the chosen user categories of academic staff, research staff and research students. This research has shown that there are some information seeking activities and information seeking problems that are the most common causes of uncertainty among significant number of users from different disciplines, age, gender, {ICT} skills, etc. This is also the case with respect to access to and use of specific information sources/channels, although the degrees of uncertainty in relation are relatively small. Possible implications of this study and further research issues are indicated.","2011","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","157 - 175","","2","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Human information behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The modelling of the spread of epidemics is one of the most widespread and commonly used areas of a modelling of complex systems. The origins of such complexity can be investigated through mathematical models termed ‘cellular automata’. Cellular automata consist of many identical components, each simple, but together capable of complex behaviour. They are analysed both as discrete dynamical systems, and as information-processing systems. Cellular Automata (CA) are well known computational substrates for studying emergent collective behaviour, complexity, randomness and interaction between order and chaotic systems. For the purpose of the article, cellular automata and differential evolution are recognized as an intuitive modelling paradigm for complex systems. The proposed cellular automata supports to find rules of the transition function that represents the model of a studied epidemic. Search for models a studied epidemic belongs to inverse problems whose solution lies in a finding of local rules guaranteeing a desired global behaviour. The epidemic models have the control parameters and their setting significantly influences the behaviour of the models. One way how to get proper values of the control parameters is use evolutionary algorithms, especially differential evolution (DE). Simulations of illness lasting from one to ten days were performed using both described approaches. The aim of the paper is to show a course of simulations for different rules of the transition function and how to find a suitable model of a studied epidemic in the case of inverse problems using a sufficient amount of local rules of a transition function.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:29","2018-02-06 16:58:29","","52 - 62","","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","differential evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most researchers have evaluated, integrated, or compared only few theories to examine user BI. In this study, we tested, compared, and unified six well-known theories, namely service quality (SQ), self-efficacy (SE), the motivational model (MM), the technology acceptance model (TAM), the theory of reasoned action or theory of planned behavior (TRA/TPB), and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), in the context of cloud computing classrooms. This empirical study was conducted using an online survey. The data collected from the samples (n = 478) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. We independently analyzed each theory, by formulating a united model. The analysis yielded three valuable findings. First, all six theoretical models and the united model exhibited adequate explanatory power. Second, variance explanation, Chi-squared statistics, effect size, and predictive relevance results revealed the ranking importance of the theoretical models. Third, the united model provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors that significantly affect the college students’ {BI} toward a cloud computing classroom.

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under {UTAUT} - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the {IT} adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate {IT} and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities.

Moreover, this pattern has been found to exist irrespective of task assignments at project initiation. Objective While this phenomenon has been noted, prior research has not sought to understand these dominant individuals. Previous work considering the effect of team structures on team performance has found that core communicators are the gatekeepers of their teams’ knowledge, and the performance of these members was correlated with their teams’ success. Building on this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core developers’ attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change over the course of their project, based on the analysis of repository data. Method We first used social network analysis (SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select artifacts from ten different software development teams. These procedures were also used to select central practitioners among these teams. We then applied psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis (CA) techniques to interpret the content of these practitioners’ messages. Finally, we inspected these core developers’ activities as recorded in system change logs at various points in time during systems’ development. Results Among our findings, we observe that core developers’ attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors were linked to their involvement in actual software development and the demands of their wider project teams. However, core developers appeared to naturally possess high levels of insightful characteristics, which became evident very early during teamwork. Conclusions Project performance would likely benefit from strategies aimed at surrounding core developers with other competent communicators. Core developers should also be supported by a wider team who are willing to ask questions and challenge their ideas. Finally, the availability of adequate communication channels would help with maintaining positive team climate, and this is likely to mitigate the negative effects of distance during distributed developments.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:44","2018-02-06 16:57:44","","1578 - 1596","","12","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Task performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:13","2018-02-06 16:57:13","","14 - 27","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","user profiling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe a novel electronic advisor system using natural language processing (NLP) to identify two geriatric medicine competencies from medical student clinical notes in the electronic medical record: advance directives (AD) and altered mental status (AMS). Materials and methods Clinical notes from third year medical students were processed using a general-purpose {NLP} system to identify biomedical concepts and their section context. The system analyzed these notes for relevance to {AD} or {AMS} and generated custom email alerts to students with embedded supplemental learning material customized to their notes. Recall and precision of the two advisors were evaluated by physician review. Students were given pre and post multiple choice question tests broadly covering geriatrics. Results Of 102 students approached, 66 students consented and enrolled. The system sent 393 email alerts to 54 students (82%), including 270 for {AD} and 123 for AMS. Precision was 100% for {AD} and 93% for AMS. Recall was 69% for {AD} and 100% for AMS. Students mentioned {ADs} for 43 patients, with all mentions occurring after first having received an {AD} reminder. Students accessed educational links 34 times from the 393 email alerts. There was no difference in pre (mean 62%) and post (mean 60%) test scores. Conclusions The system effectively identified two educational opportunities using {NLP} applied to clinical notes and demonstrated a small change in student behavior. Use of electronic advisors such as these may provide a scalable model to assess specific competency elements and deliver educational opportunities.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:00","2018-02-06 16:58:00","","292 - 299","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advanced directives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyzing students' behavior in online learning activities and detecting specific patterns of interaction in {LMS} is a topic of great interest for the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) research communities. Previous studies have focused primarily on frequency analysis without addressing the temporal aspects of students' learning behavior. Therefore, we apply a process-oriented approach, investigating perspectives on using process mining methods in the context of online learning and assessment. To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students' interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings. Using process mining methods, we identify specific types of interaction sequences that shed new light on students’ quiz-taking strategies in LMS. We believe that these findings bring important implications for researchers studying student behavior in online environments as well as practitioners using online quizzes for learning and assessment.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:35","2018-02-21 13:58:06","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Educational data mining; Learning analytics; learning management system; Learning management system; Process mining; Quiz-taking behavior; Student interaction analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposed and evaluated a speech system for behavioral analysis of {PLTL} groups. It could help in identifying the best practices for PLTL. The CRSS-PLTL corpus was used for evaluation of developed algorithms. In this paper, we developed a robust speech activity detection (SAD) by fusing the outputs of a DNN-based pitch extractor and an unsupervised {SAD} based on voicing measures. Robust speaker diarization system consisted of bottleneck features (from stacked autoencoder) and informed HMM-based joint segmentation and clustering system. Behavioral characteristics such as participation, dominance, emphasis, curiosity and engagement were extracted by acoustic analyses of speech segments belonging to all students. We proposed a novel method for detecting question inflection and performed equal error rate analysis on {PLTL} corpus. In addition, a robust approach for detecting emphasized speech regions was also proposed. Further, we performed exploratory data analysis for understanding the distortion present in CRSS-PLTL corpus as it was collected in naturalistic scenario. The ground-truth Likert scale ratings were used for capturing the team dynamics in terms of student’s responses to a variety of evaluation questions. Results suggested the applicability of proposed system for behavioral analysis of small-group conversations such as PLTL, work-place meetings etc..","2017","2018-02-06 16:57:19","2018-02-06 16:57:19","","343 - 366","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Small-group conversations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Employees are exposed to ever increasingly culturally diverse workforces. Since an individual’s emotions are greatly influenced by culture, how one copes with and manages emotions differ largely based on one’s ethnic and national background. That can be extended to include how one manages others. That is, a manager’s consideration of specific, culturally patterned emotional expressions and behaviors of each member in their workforce has been found to correlate directly with the efficacy of administrating people of varying cultural backgrounds. In short, this study builds on previous research showing that emotional intelligence (EI), also known as emotional quotient (EQ), depends on national culture and reports data acquired to assess the causal relationship between {EI} and professional achievements such as salary and job position, as well as other demographic variables such as education level, age and gender.","2017","2018-02-06 16:58:55","2018-02-06 16:58:55","","67 - 94","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for instance, shows that climate is changing and with a 95% certainty it is the humans have caused the change. The future climatic conditions are shown to be largely adversely affecting human wellbeing on this planet. Yet we see in numerous examples that societies are very slow in reacting to this rapid depletion of natural resources. What still seems lacking is the translation of scientific reports and the results of analysis and modelling into corrective actions. We argue that one of the reasons for this is the traditional workflow of environmental modelling, which starts with the purpose, the goal formulation, and ends with problem solutions or decision support tools. Instead, modelling, and applied science in general, has to enhance its scope beyond the problem solving stage, to do more on the problem definition and solution implementation phases. Modelling can be also used for identification of societal values and for setting purposes by appropriate communication of the modelling process and results. We believe this new approach for modelling can impact and bring the social values to the forefront of socio-environmental debate and hence turn scientific results into actions sooner rather than later. Instead of being separated from the modelling process, the translation of results should be an intrinsic part of it. We discuss several challenges for recent socio-environmental modelling and conclude with ten propositions that modellers and scientists in general can follow to improve their communication with the society and produce results that can be understood and used to improve awareness and education and spur action.","2014","2018-02-06 16:59:09","2018-02-06 16:59:09","","207 - 212","","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Science and policy interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empirical evidence explaining the gender gap in gaming time is still scarce. The present study aims to evaluate if the higher gaming time can be attributed to gender specific game genre preferences. Methods A nationwide representative survey comprising 3073 participants aged 16–93 years (M = 49.1; SD = 18.2) was conducted. Video game use and genre preferences were assessed via a written questionnaire. {OLS} regression and subsequent mediation analyses were used to determine significant predictors of gaming time and to evaluate the contribution of genre preferences. Results Higher age, high education and employment predicted lower gaming time whereas male gender and the preference of certain game genres predicted higher gaming time. Mediation analyses revealed that the higher gaming time of males is fully mediated by the higher preference of role-playing and shooter games among this gender group. Conclusion The higher gaming time of men is fully accounted for by the male specific preference for certain game genres. Future research should address the functional connection between genre preferences and gaming behavior in further detail.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:19","2018-02-06 16:58:19","","729 - 735","","","55, Part B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Genre preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on research impact, internationalization and leadership indicators, which became important benchmarks in a worldwide discussion about research quality and impact policies for universities. Our data visualization reveals a qualitative difference between the behavior of Northern American and Western European Higher Education Institutions concerning International collaboration levels. Chinese universities show still a systematic low international collaboration levels which are positively linked to the low research impact. The data suggests that research impact can be related directly to internationalization only to rather low values for both indicators. Above world average, other determinants may become relevant in fostering further impact. The leadership indicator provides further insights to the collaborative environment of universities in different geographical regions, as well as the optimized collaboration portfolio for enhancing research impact.","2014","2018-02-06 16:58:05","2018-02-06 16:58:05","","642 - 649","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Research impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present the application of NICSim-vhd, which is an acronym for VHDL-based Network Interface Card simulation model, as a pedagogical tool for supporting undergraduate computer science students’ education. NICSim-vhd allows simulating the network-to-memory data path at a network node and generating Value Change Dump (VCD) files for simulation visualization of hardware description languages-based models. We provide a taxonomy of learner engagement with simulation visualization. Grounded in Bloom’s well recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest how to assess the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:42","2018-02-06 16:56:42","","-","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VHDL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines students' acceptance of a web-based summative listening test administered in the 2014–2015 academic year within an ‘English as a Foreign Language' course at a two-year post-secondary military school in Turkey. The participants consisted of 602 military students. As a model, Computer Based Assessment Acceptance Model based on Technology Acceptance Model was adopted in order to analyze the participants' perceptions on a web-based summative listening comprehension test. The data were collected via an online questionnaire. A structural equation modeling analysis was utilized to analyze the relationships among factors. The general results showed that perceived ease of use and perceived playfulness had a direct influence on the participants' behavioral intentions to use web-based tests. In other words, web-based tests are expected to be used if they are easy to use and playful enough.","2016","2018-02-06 16:57:24","2018-02-06 16:57:24","","522 - 531","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Online testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hearing handicapped children are acknowledged to have problems for teaching and learning. Addressing the problems of teaching hearing handicapped children needs to take the advantages from the recent advanced mobile technology, such as mobile app game. Strategies will vary from the traditional method and by gender and social context. In this paper, we proposed research questions and objective for this study. Then, we discuss the definitions of hearing handicapped, hearing impairment children, their study and learning problems in the literature review. We also proposed a design model for the development of mobile application game that can teach and train the hearing handicapped children to learn new knowledge and for speaking purposes. We also propose the block diagram of the voice recognition mobile apps game design for hearing handicapped children. We adapt the mobile application that leverages some strategies from proven behavior change theories: increasing interest of learning, fostering motivation, self-efficacy and impacting handicapped peoples’ attitude to study.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:13","2018-02-06 16:58:13","","479 - 486","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","hearing impairment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Learning personalisation is analysed in terms of suitability of {LOs} and {VLEs} to particular learning styles. The novel sets portrait analysing interconnections between students’ learning styles, their preferred learning activities, relevant teaching/learning methods, and {LOs} types is presented in more detail. The well-known standardised vocabularies of teaching/learning methods and {LOs} types were used to establish these interconnections. The sets portrait of these interconnections is followed by the appropriate ontology. The ontology is considered as an appropriate tool to create learners’ personalised learning environments consisting of LOs, suitable teaching/learning methods and activities according to their preferred learning styles. The ontology should help the learner to find suitable {LOs} according to preferred learning methods/activities, and vice versa, and thus to personalise learning. The presented Web 3.0 – based approaches are the typical cases of information and communication technologies (ICT’s) application for development of human capital.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:18","2018-02-21 12:00:31","","654 - 662","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICT’s for human capital; Learners’ behaviour; Learning objects; Learning styles; Personalisation; Virtual learning environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach emphasizes specification of component behavior and component interaction as separate concerns at the architectural level, consistent with well-accepted definitions of SoS. The Monterey Phoenix (MP) approach provides features for prediction of emergent SoS behaviors. An example highlights limitations of current modeling languages and approaches that hinder prediction of emergent behavior, and demonstrates how the application of {MP} can enhance SoS modeling capability through the following principles:• Model component interactions as general rules, orthogonal to the component behavior. • Automatically extract possible scenarios (use cases) from descriptions of system behavior. • Test system behavior against stakeholder expectations/requirements using scenario inspection and assertion checking. {MP} provides a new capability for automatically verifying system behaviors early in the lifecycle, when design flaws are most easily and inexpensively corrected. {MP} extends existing frameworks and allows multiple visualizations for different stakeholders, and has potential for application in multiple domains.","2013","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","277 - 282","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","complex systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been the dominant approach in the vision science of the last half century, and it is currently one of the fundamental methods of investigation for most higher cognitive functions. Yet, neurocomputational approaches to moral behavior are lacking. Computational modeling in general has been scarcely pursued in morality, and existent non-neural attempts have failed to account for the mental processes involved in morality. In this paper we argue that recently the situation has evolved in a way that subverted the insufficient knowledge on the basic organization of moral cognition in brain circuits, making the project of modeling morality in neurocomputational terms feasible. We will present an original architecture that combines reinforcement learning and Hebbian learning, aimed at simulating forms of moral behavior in a simple artificial context. The relationship between language and morality is controversial. In the analytic tradition of philosophy, morality is essentially the language of morals. On the other side, current cognitive ethology has shown how non human species display behaviors that are surprisingly similar to those prescribed by human ethics. Nevertheless, morality in humans is deeply entrenched with language, and the semantics of words like ‘wrong’ resists consensual explanations. The model here proposed includes an auditory processing pathway, with the purpose of showing how the coding of “wrong”, even if highly simplified with respect to its rich content in natural language, can emerge in the course of moral learning.","2016","2018-02-06 16:58:14","2018-02-06 16:58:14","","4 - 14","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","self-organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mediation analysis revealed that the proximal variables attitude, subjective norm, and self-efficacy towards {DLMs} were significant predictors of teachers’ intention to use DLMs. The contribution of subjective norm, however, was modest. Attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy mediated the effects of the following three distal variables on intention: previous use of DLMs, perceived knowledge and skills to use DLMs, and colleagues’ usage of DLMs. Persuasive communication and skills based training seem, therefore, appropriate interventions to promote a positive attitude towards {DLMs} and improve self-efficacy in using DLMs.","2013","2018-02-06 16:57:53","2018-02-06 16:57:53","","217 - 225","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","teachers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to show that the occurrence of pure delay should not be neglected when planning a telephone or conferencing system even if no impact on the perceived quality of the call can be found. It is, for instance, known that, the communication surface structure changes dramatically when transmission delay is inserted by the communication system. Furthermore, studies suggest a change in the perception of the interlocutor at the far-end. This paper describes two experiments that assess the misattribution of the technical impairment delay to personality and behavior-related attributes of the conversation partners. The first experiment shows that interlocutors are perceived as being less attentive when conversing in a three-party setting with symmetrical and asymmetrical delay conditions. In the second experiment, the misattribution is considered in more detail looking at ascribed personality attributes in two-party interaction under transmission delay. For both experiments, comparing the conversation surface structure of delayed to non-delayed calls helped to understand the found outcomes.","2014","2018-02-06 16:57:45","2018-02-06 16:57:45","","477 - 487","","5","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, 13% of the sample had posted illegal activity (underage drinking, lewd behavior, or other illegal activity) and 28% had recorded (or been present when someone else recorded) lewd or other illegal activity. Prevalence rates were higher among those who used social media excessively and those who met criteria for {ASPD} or BPD. However, in logistic regression analyses, only social media use and {ASPD} emerged as unique predictors of posting and recording illegal material. Thus, there appear to be at least two separate routes to recording and/or posting illegal material. One fairly innocuous route is the excessive use of social media, which may desensitize individuals and hinder their ability to apply appropriate filters. Another more ominous route is a pervasive psychological disorder (ASPD), which is associated with lifelong recklessness, impulsivity, and lack of empathy. For either route, education on the lifelong ramifications of digital media is imperative.","2015","2018-02-06 16:58:26","2018-02-06 16:58:26","","608 - 614","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social media use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A moderated trend analysis","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","1386-5056","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.12.023","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505617304744","AbstractObjective To investigate acute care hospitals’ adoption speed of patient engagement health information technology (HIT) functionalities from 2008 to 2013 and how this speed is contingent on environmental factors and hospital characteristics. Methods Data on non-government acute care hospitals located in the United States was obtained from merging three databases: the American Hospital Association’s (AHA) annual survey information technology supplement, {AHA} annual survey, and the Area Health Resource File (AHRF). The variables obtained from these datasets were the amount of annually adopted patient engagement {HIT} functionalities and environmental and organizational characteristics. Environmental factors included were uncertainty, munificence, and complexity. Hospital characteristics included size, system membership, ownership, and teaching status. Results A regression analysis of 4176 hospital-year observations revealed a positive trend in the adoption of {HIT} functionalities for patient engagement (β= 1.109, p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the study showed that large, system-affiliated, not-for-profit, teaching hospitals adopt patient engagement {HIT} functionalities at a faster speed than their counterparts. Environmental munificence and uncertainty were also associated with an accelerating speed of adoption. Environmental complexity however did not show a significant impact on the speed of adoption. Discussion From 2008 to 2013, there was a significant acceleration in the speed of adopting patient engagement {HIT} functionalities. Further efforts should be made to ensure proper adoption and consistent use by patients in order to reap the benefits of these {IT} investments. Conclusion Hospitals adopted at least one {HIT} functionality for patient engagement per year. The adoption speed varied across hospitals, depending on both environmental and organizational factors.","2018","2018-02-06 16:57:09","2018-02-06 16:57:09","","123 - 130","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hospital characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We posited that job demands negatively predict lecturers' work engagement (H1), whereas job resources positively predict it (H2) and that lecturers' work engagement positively predicts their intention to continue to teach synchronous distance education courses (H3) and fully mediates the relationship between job demands and job resources and lecturers' intention to continue to teach synchronous distance education courses (H4). The results of the multilevel analysis supported the proposed hypotheses. These findings have important practical implications because they elucidate the potential hindrances and contributors that may affect lecturers' intention to teach synchronous distance education courses (the next mainstream teaching approach, which is cost-free but increases universities’ profit) through influencing their work engagement levels.","2017","2018-02-06 16:56:53","2018-02-06 16:56:53","","655 - 663","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Synchronous distance education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
