Analyzing students' behavior in online learning activities and detecting specific patterns of interaction in \{LMS\} is a topic of great interest for the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) research communities. Previous studies have focused primarily on frequency analysis without addressing the temporal aspects of students' learning behavior. Therefore, we apply a process-oriented approach, investigating perspectives on using process mining methods in the context of online learning and assessment. To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students' interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings. Using process mining methods, we identify specific types of interaction sequences that shed new light on students’ quiz-taking strategies in LMS. We believe that these findings bring important implications for researchers studying student behavior in online environments as well as practitioners using online quizzes for learning and assessment.},

This work outlines a novel approach for analyzing behavioral learner data through the application of process mining techniques specifically targeting a complex problem solving process. We realize this in the context of one particular learning case, namely, domain modeling. This work extends our previous research on process-mining analysis of domain modeling behavior of novices by elaborating with new insights from a replication study enhanced with an extra observation on how novices verify/validate models. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the results contribute to improving our knowledge on the cognitive aspects of problem-solving behavior of novices in the area of domain modeling, specifically regarding process-oriented feedback as opposed to traditional outcome feedback (is a solution correct? Why (not)?) usually applied in this type of courses. Ultimately, the outcomes of the work can be inspirational outside of the area of domain modeling as learning event data is becoming readily available through virtual learning environments and other information systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract With the emergence of online learning, many similar courses are offered on the Internet. The Internet is an essential tool for improving learning efficiency by analyzing how learners select courses; it is also a convenient channel to extract learner preferences. We adopt dynamic learning data from a popular Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) website in China, imooc.com, to detect the online learning behavior pattern of Chinese online learners and estimate herding behavior. Considering the large number of similar online courses, this study determines how a suitable course can be selected. We first evince the existence of herding in online learning and then divide herding behavior into different groups: some learners passively mimic their peers (irrational herding), whereas some learners engage in active observational learning according to their needs (rational herding). The results reveal that rational herding dominates online learning. Subsequently, some variables amplify the herding effect, such as the difficulty level of the course and the experience of the learners. We conclude that the higher the difficulty level of a course, the more the rational herding of the learners and that the more experienced the learners, the higher the rational herding. This study provides implications for the way in course selection in MOOC, specifically in the learning analytics of the online learners.},

In the educational context outcome feedback is usually applied to improve learning achievements. However, not many research publications have been written observing the characteristics of a modeling process itself that can be associated with better/worse learning outcomes, nor have any empirically validated results been reported on the observations of modeling activities in the educational context. This paper attempts to cover this gap for conceptual modeling. We analyze modeling behavior (conceptual modeling event data of 20 cases, 10.000 events in total) using experimental logging functionality of the \{JMermaid\} modeling tool and process mining techniques. The outcomes of the work include modeling patterns that are indicative for worse/better learning performance. The results contribute to (1) improving teaching guidance for conceptual modeling targeted at process-oriented feedback, (2) providing recommendations on the type of data that can be useful in observing a modeling behavior from the perspective of learning outcomes. In addition, the study provides first insights for learning analytics research in the domain of conceptual modeling.},

The high attrition rates associated with \{MOOCs\} have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with \{MOOCs\} and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.},

Prior research has investigated the impact of forum reading and posting, as well as access to reading resources, on academic performance. However, little is known about the relationship between the temporal frequency of these activities and individual student’s performance. In addition, some studies have proposed different categorizations of student activities, and proved the usefulness of these characterizations for predictive purposes and better understanding of the learning process. One of the biggest concerns when teaching courses in a virtual learning environment is to create and develop instruction in a way that it improves the overall learning experience and results. The present study addresses this concern by drawing upon factors influencing academic performance; more specifically, the study focuses on objective factors related to the interaction between the student and the system (number of resources visited in the learning platform, and number of forum posts and views). On top of that, a visualization tool was designed and implemented to allow for further investigation of the relevance of the study variables. The results from the study show that there is a recurrent pattern in the frequency of behaviors and performance across different courses.},

Learning analytics in \{IT\} environment helps us understand the whole process of students' learning in groups, analyze these problems in collaborative learning and find ways to improve group learning effect. We examined the role of Slack in students' engagement in collaborative learning. Specifically, whether the openness and visibility of each group member's contribution on Slack can promote students' engagement. Based on the benefits and loss of engagement, we proposed the research model and hypotheses. Surveys (n = 181) were issued online to postgraduate students at different times of a course in China. Data was analysed by SmartPLS. Results show that mutual trust, social influence and reward valence among students can promote their teamwork engagement. Furthermore, teamwork engagement can prompt students' learning and work satisfaction. However, the moderation role of task complexity between teamwork engagement and personal success (i.e. learning and work satisfaction) is not supported. Theoretical contribution and implications for educational practices are discussed. Research limitations and future research directions are also presented.},

This paper presents our approach on how the usage of \{VLEs\} (Virtual Learning Environments) can be traced and used to enhance the teaching quality so as to improve engagement. We focus our work on secondary education. The question is not to predict the performance of students, from the collected data, which is always controversial; or just define a set of pre-established metrics, obtained from the digital data contained into the VLE, and monitor them, indirectly inducing an assessment regime. The aim is to look beyond the traces left by students and to measure the motivation of a student in a particular task, of a given subject, and in a specific day. For this purpose, we rely on the psychometric theory of measurement to build a composite index of motivation and we embed it into a Learning Analytics system. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide teachers and stakeholders with objective and accurate (quasi) real time information about students’ motivation for learning, and hence adequately adapt and personalize the teaching methodologies and strategies in classrooms. The approach is general and can also be used in tertiary education for training students and researchers in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing.},

However, with a distance methodology, these observations are not possible. When forums are created they are intended to discuss particular topics. It is relevant to monitor that the topics discussed are the intended ones in order to achieve course objectives. To tackle this shortcoming, our work studies the dynamics of relevant topics in on-line asynchronous discussion forums, and this is done by analyzing the large amount of students’ interactions generated in the forums of our Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we analyze the students’ behavior patterns in the forums of a distance subject, and characterize the relevant topics and subtopics from the forums’ messages belonging to two academic years. From the statistical and graphical results obtained, a set of valuable recommendations are also given.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many researchers who study the impact of computer-based assessment (CBA) focus on the affordances or complexities of \{CBA\} approaches in comparison to traditional assessment methods. This study examines how \{CBA\} approaches were configured within and between modules, and the impact of assessment design on students' engagement, satisfaction, and pass rates. The analysis was conducted using a combination of longitudinal visualisations, correlational analysis, and fixed-effect models on 74 undergraduate modules and their 72,377 students. Our findings indicate that educators designed very different assessment strategies, which significantly influenced student engagement as measured by time spent in the virtual learning environment (VLE). Weekly analyses indicated that assessment activities were balanced with other learning activities, which suggests that educators tended to aim for a consistent workload when designing assessment strategies. Since most of the assessments were computer-based, students spent more time on the \{VLE\} during assessment weeks. By controlling for heterogeneity within and between modules, learning design could explain up to 69\% of the variability in students' time spent on the VLE. Furthermore, assessment activities were significantly related to pass rates, but no clear relation with satisfaction was found. Our findings highlight the importance of \{CBA\} and learning design to how students learn online.},

	abstract = {Abstract Pedagogically informed designs of learning are increasingly of interest to researchers in blended and online learning, as learning design is shown to have an impact on student behaviour and outcomes. Although learning design is widely studied, often these studies are individual courses or programmes and few empirical studies have connected learning designs of a substantial number of courses with learning behaviour. In this study we linked 151 modules and 111.256 students with students' behaviour (\&lt;400 million minutes of online behaviour), satisfaction and performance at the Open University \{UK\} using multiple regression models. Our findings strongly indicate the importance of learning design in predicting and understanding Virtual Learning Environment behaviour and performance of students in blended and online environments. In line with proponents of social learning theories, our primary predictor for academic retention was the time learners spent on communication activities, controlling for various institutional and disciplinary factors. Where possible, appropriate and well designed communication tasks that align with the learning objectives of the course may be a way forward to enhance academic retention.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper reports on the findings of an exploratory study in which the effects of technological scaffolding interventions on micro-level processes of self-regulated learning in the workplace were investigated. Empirical research in the workplace has been much less represented than in formal education. Even less research is available that aimed to identify which technological scaffolding interventions, out of those available in a learning environment, had the highest influence on specific micro-level process of self-regulated learning. This paper reports on the findings of a case study conducted in the naturalistic settings of two organizations in Europe (N = 53) for the period of two months. Trace data about the events of engagement with the technological scaffolding interventions and micro-level processes of self-regulated learning were collected. Both a transition graph based analysis of the temporal dependencies of the collected events and multiple linear regression analyses showed that an intervention that promoted social awareness had consistently the highest effect on all the micro-level processes used in the study. This intervention was followed by the intervention that offered system-generated recommendations about learning paths, learning activities and knowledge assets to stimulate engagement into the micro-level processes within the forethought or preparatory phase of self-regulated learning. These findings suggest that both the social and organizational contexts should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at supporting the forethought and engagement phases. Further discussion about research, methodological, and learning technology design implications is provided.},

Recent research on these programs has focused primarily on how students’ incoming demographics and prior academic performance predict academic performance at the university level. This study investigated changes in students’ academic motivation orientations over the course of one bridge program, and how a learning analytics-based intervention was employed by academic advisors to inform their face-to-face meetings with students. The results of our study show that students’ mastery orientation decreased over the course of the bridge program, and indicate that students’ exposure to displays of their academic performance negatively predicts this change. The findings suggest that student perceptions of their goals and formative performance need to be carefully considered in the design of learning analytics interventions since the resulting tools can affect students’ interpretations of their own data as well as their subsequent academic success.},

Visual Environment for Designing Interactive Learning Scenarios (VEDILS), a visual tool for designing, customising and deploying learning technologies, provides teachers with a development environment with a low entry threshold. Current mobile devices are equipped with sensors and have sufficient processing power to use augmented reality technologies. Despite the heavy use of mobile devices in students’ lives, the use of augmented reality mobile applications as learning tools is not widespread among teachers. The current work presents a framework comprising the development tool and a method for designing and deploying learning activities. It focuses on the augmented reality components of the authoring tools, which allow users to create their own mobile augmented reality learning apps. It also present the results of the evaluation of the framework with 47 third-level educators, and two case studies of classroom implementations of mobile augmented reality apps developed by these educators. The results illustrate the suitability of the framework and authoring tool for supporting users without programming skills in developing their own apps.},

Predictive analytics with Big Data in education will improve educational programs for students and fund-raising campaigns for donors (Siegel, 2013). Research in both educational data mining (EDM) and data analytics (LA) continues to increase (Siemens, 2013; Baker and Siemens, 2014). The key elements of recruitment, learning, and retention can be tracked and increased over time in both cases for administrators and donor development. A few early examples of Big Data programs in these key areas of formal education will be reviewed. The paradigms of educational psychology can inform the construction of systems that maximize “engagement.” Contemporary educational technology enables the personalization of education whether face to face or at a distance. More responsive evaluation systems will allow the school to demonstrate the effectiveness of its services. There is more opportunity for education as a sustainable enterprise with the implementation of Big Data, both locally and globally.},

How to provide appropriate feedback to students on the state of their knowledge and supplying a sufficient number of practice problems are major concerns for many courses. Creating engaging and interactive course materials is another challenge for many educators. We explore how an eTextbook can be used to address these issues and improve learning outcomes. Through several case studies, we discuss how information gathered from user interaction logs can be used both to understand student behavior and to improve the system. We explore the deployment of basic gamification techniques within an eTextbook to motivate students and to encourage them toward more learning-oriented behavior.},
