The time course of this effect, however, is poorly specified. In an initial experiment, using an analysis of the microstructure of licking in mice we found that consumption of sucrose led to a rapid reduction in lick cluster size, a measure of palatability, which recovered after 10 min, but reemerged 60min after initial consumption. We then replicated the finding that lick cluster size is reduced after 60min, but not 10min, under conditions in which a number of potential behavioural confounds were removed. In Experiment 2 the effect was replicated using a between-subjects design that ruled out the possibility that the effect was a specific consequence of the within-subjects procedures used in the first experiment, in which mice may have come to expect sucrose at different time points within the feeding session. While Experiments 1 and 2 confounded the time between periods of access to sucrose with time since the start of the feeding session, this confound was removed in Experiment 3, and, similar to the previous experiments, it was found that a second reduction in palatability occurred after 60min. Therefore, the effect was dependent only on the time since the previous exposure to sucrose, demonstrating that sucrose consumption initiates a biphasic reduction in palatability. The reduction in lick cluster size after 60min was not typically accompanied by a reduction in consumption suggesting that the more slowly developing reduction in the palatability measure was not simply a consequence of post-ingestive satiety. The cause of the biphasic change is not yet clear, and may reflect independent processes or the consequence of a single process that initiates multiple changes in palatability over time.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:11","2019-02-27 20:57:11","","129 - 134","","","184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","adaptation; Feeding behavior; Hedonia; Licking; Memory; Satiety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unsupervised access to information may arouse the adolescent's interest and predispose the use of drugs. Methodology This is a cross-sectional study using data from National School-based Health Survey (PeNSE, 2012), with sample of 109,104 Brazilian students in 42.717 schools. Outcomes were: self-reported use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs in the past 30 days. Main exposures were contextual and included: library and media resources availability, computer room and internet available at school. Data analysis included multilevel logistic regression. Results Prevalence of alcohol use was 25.2% (IC95% 24.7–25.6), tobacco use was 5.3% (IC95% 5.1–5.5) and use of other drugs was 2.6% (IC95% 2.5–2.7). Multilevel analysis showed that recent use of alcohol and tobacco was associated to the presence of computer room and internet, while the use of other drugs presented an association with all media. Conclusion Results indicate that supervision in access to information and communication resources may play a role on the prevention of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs use by students.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","66 - 70","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescents; Alcohol; Education; Multilevel modelling; Tobacco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For individuals who reside at this interface, particularly those in low-resource settings, the development of disease risk assessment and mitigation skills must be prioritized. Using a community engagement-One Health approach, we implemented a training program aimed at advancing these skills among agro-pastoralists living adjacent to conservation areas in South Africa. The program included professional development of local facilitators who then conducted workshops with community members. Workshops used a series of experiential, inquiry-based activities to teach participants the concepts of pathogen transmission and disease risk assessment and mitigation. The program was implemented over four weeks with 10 facilitators and 78 workshop participants. We conducted a within-subjects experimental study using a mixed methods design to evaluate the program in terms of facilitator and participant One Health knowledge and practices. Quantitative data included pre/post written assessments; qualitative data included focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and pre/post photographs. Mean post-test scores of facilitators increased by 17% (p=0.0078). For workshop participants, improvements in knowledge were more likely for females than males (OR=7.315, 95% CI=2.258–23.705, p=0.0009) and participants with a higher versus lower education level, albeit borderline non-significant (OR=4.781, 95% CI=0.942–24.264, p=0.0590). Qualitative analysis revealed the implementation of risk mitigation strategies by 98% (60/61) of workshop participants during the three-month follow-up and included improved personal and domestic hygiene practices and enhanced animal housing. Although further evaluation is recommended, this program may be appropriate for consideration as a scalable approach by which to mitigate human and animal infectious disease risk in high-risk/low-resource communities.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:34","2019-02-27 20:57:34","","9 - 20","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","community engagement; experiential learning; Health promotion; infectious disease; Program evaluation; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Germany, no routine surveillance of HBV prevalence and vaccination coverage among PWID exists. Methods Socio-demographic and behavioural data were collected between 2011 and 2014 through face-to-face interviews, during a bio-behavioural survey of PWID recruited in eight German cities. Dried blood spots (DBS) prepared with capillary blood were tested for HBV markers. Factors associated with past/current HBV infection and vaccination status were analysed by univariable and multivariable analysis using logistic regression. The validity of self-reported HBV infection and vaccination status was analysed by comparison to the laboratory results. Results Among 2077 participants, the prevalence of current HBV infection was 1.1%, of past HBV infection was 24%, and of vaccine-induced HBV antibodies was 32%. No detectable HBV antibodies were found in 43%. HBV infection status was significantly associated with study city, age, years of injecting, use of stimulants, migration status, and homelessness; HBV vaccination status was significantly associated with study city, age, and level of education. Correct infection status was reported by 71% and correct vaccination status by 45%. Conclusions HBV seroprevalence among PWID was about five times higher than in the general population in Germany, confirming PWID as an important risk group. Targeted information campaigns on HBV and HBV prevention for PWID and professionals in contact with PWID need to be intensified. Routinely offered HBV vaccination during imprisonment and opioid substitution therapy would likely improve vaccination rates among PWID.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:44","2019-02-27 20:57:44","","5 - 13","","","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","HBV; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B vaccination; People who inject drugs; PWID; Sero- and behavioural survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 300 university alumni records was used to obtain their respective attribute values consisting of demographics, preferred communication channels, lifestyle, activities/interests, and expectation from university, needed information, donation willingness, and frequency of contact. The researcher used logistic regression and the k-mean clustering technique to analyze the data from the survey. Five segments could be derived from the analysis. Segment 3, the so-called “Mid Age Religious” contained the highest portion while segment 5, the so-called “Elaborate Cohort” had the least portion. Most of the population under these two segments was female. Differences were identified in age, marital status, education, occupation, position, income, experience, and field of work. The Elaborate Cohort segment represented young females having a bachelor degree, with low experience and low income, working for their first employer, and still enjoying being single. Another segment with similar values of attributes as the Elaborate Cohort was segment 1, the so-called “Activist Mainstreamer” whose field of work was computer technology. The segment called “Senior League” consisted of members older than 41 years like the Mid Age Religious segment, however all members were male. The last segment, the so-called “Passionate Learner” had members aged between 31 and 40 years. In conclusion, the results of this study can assist in formulating strategic marketing by alumni associations to satisfy and engage their alumni.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:12","2019-02-27 20:57:12","","150 - 160","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cluster; data mining; segmentation analysis; university alumni","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods In the period 2010–15, 716 consecutive NAFLD cases (mean age, 52; type 2 diabetes, 33%) were treated in our Department with structured programs. The usual protocol included motivational interviewing and a group-based intervention (GBI), chaired by physicians, dietitians and psychologists (five weekly meetings, n = 438). Individuals who could not attend GBI entered a web-based intervention (WBI, n = 278) derived from GBI, with interactive games, learning tests, motivational tests, and mail contacts with the center. The primary outcome was weight loss ≥10%; secondary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase within normal limits, changes in lifestyle, weight, alanine aminotransferase, and surrogate markers of steatosis and fibrosis. Results GBI and WBI cohorts had similar body mass index (mean, 33 kg/m2), with more males (67% vs. 45%), younger age, higher education, and more physical activity in the WBI group. The two-year attrition rate was higher in the WBI group. Healthy lifestyle changes were observed in both groups and body mass index decreased by almost two points;the 10% weight target was reached in 20% of WBI cases vs. 15% in GBI (not significant). In logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounders and attrition rates, WBI was not associated with a reduction of patients reaching short- and long-term 10% weight targets. Liver enzymes decreased in both groups, and normalized more frequently in WBI. Fatty liver index was reduced, whereas fibrosis remained stable (NAFLD fibrosis score) or similarly decreased (Fib-4). Conclusion WBI is not less effective than common lifestyle programs, as measured by significant clinical outcomes associated with improved histological outcomes in NAFLD. eHealth programs may effectively contribute to NAFLD control. Lay summary In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be jeopardized by job and time constraints. A web-based intervention may be better suited for young, busy patients, and for those living far from liver units. The study shows that, following a structured motivational approach, a web-based, interactive intervention coupled with six-month face-to-face meetings is not inferior to a standard group-based intervention with respect to weight loss, adherence to healthy diet and habitual physical activity, normalization of liver enzymes, and stable surrogate markers of fibrosis.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:59","2019-02-27 20:57:59","","1155 - 1163","","5","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Diet; Liver enzymes; NAFLD progression; physical activity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Three rat subcutaneous implantation methods were evaluated in six Sprague Dawley rats. An acellular xenograft made from porcine pericardium was used as the tissue-scaffold. Three implantation methods were performed; 1) Suture method is where a tissue-scaffold was implanted by suturing its border to the external oblique muscle, 2) Control method is where a tissue-scaffold was implanted without any suturing or support, 3) Frame method is where a tissue-scaffold was attached to a circular frame composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) biomaterial and placed subcutaneously. After 1 and 4 weeks, tissue-scaffolds were explanted and evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson’s trichrome,Picrosirius Red, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry, and mechanical testing. Results Macroscopically, tissue-scaffold degradation with the suture method and tissue-scaffold folding with the control method were observed after 4 weeks. In comparison, the frame method demonstrated intact tissue scaffolds after 4 weeks. H&E staining showed progressive cell repopulation over the course of the experiment in all groups with acute and chronic inflammation observed in suture and control methods throughout the duration of the study. Immunohistochemistry quantification of CD3, CD 31, CD 34, CD 163, and αSMA showed a statistically significant differences between the suture, control and frame methods (P < 0.05) at both time points. The average tensile strength was 4.03 ± 0.49, 7.45 ± 0.49 and 5.72 ± 1.34 (MPa) after 1 week and 0.55 ± 0.26, 0.12 ± 0.03 and 0.41 ± 0.32 (MPa) after 4 weeks in the suture, control, and frame methods; respectively. TEM analysis showed an increase in inflammatory cells in both suture and control methods following implantation. Conclusion Rat subcutaneous implantation with the frame method was performed with success and ease. The surgical approach used for the frame technique was found to be the best methodology for in vivo evaluation of tissue engineered acellular scaffolds, where the frame method did not compromise mechanical strength, but it reduced inflammation significantly.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:59","2019-02-27 20:57:59","","282 - 291","","3","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acellular xenograft; Extracellular matrix; Histology; Inflammation; Mechanical behavior; Subcutaneous implantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the interplay of a broad array of factors that influence health status may not be adequately captured with parametric multivariate regression. This study investigated associations between several health determinants and SRH using recursive partitioning methods. This non-parametric analytic approach aimed to reflect the social-ecological model of health, emphasizing relationships between multiple health determinants, including biological, behavioral, and from social/physical environments. The study sample of 3648 men and women was drawn from the year 15 (2000–2001) data collection of the CARDIA Study, USA, in order to study a young adult sample. Classification tree analysis identified 15 distinct, mutually exclusive, subgroups (eight with a larger proportion of individuals with higher SRH, and seven with a larger proportion of lower SRH), and multi-domain risk and protective factors associated with subgroup membership. Health determinant profiles were not uniform between subgroups, even for those with similar health status. The subgroup with the largest proportion of higher SRH was characterized by several protective factors, whilst that with the largest proportion of lower SRH, with several negative risk factors; certain factors were associated with both higher and lower SRH subgroups. In the full sample, physical activity, education and income were highest ranked by variable importance (random forests analysis) in association with SRH. This exploratory study demonstrates the utility of recursive partitioning methods in studying the joint impact of multiple health determinants. The findings indicate that factors do not affect SRH in the same way across the whole sample. Multiple factors from different domains, and with varying relative importance, are associated with SRH in different subgroups. This has implications for developing and prioritizing appropriate interventions to target conditions and factors that improve self-rated health status.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:34","2019-02-27 20:57:34","","178 - 188","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classification tree analysis; Health determinants; Random forests; Recursive partitioning methods; Self-rated health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Participants included 190 patients with schizophrenia (mean ± standard deviation age: 37.7 ± 10.8 years; 88 males and 102 females) and 312 healthy individuals (mean ± standard deviation age: 38.1 ± 13.8; 166 males and 146 females), matched for age, sex, and ethnicity (Japanese). Premorbid intelligence quotient was estimated using the Japanese Adult Reading Test and distress symptoms were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Current smoking information was collected according to self-declarations. Results As expected, the smoking rate was higher, while mean education level and Japanese Adult Reading Test scores were significantly lower, in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals (p < 0.01). The mean education level and Japanese Adult Reading Test scores were significantly lower in the smoker group than in the non-smoker group in both patients and healthy individuals (p < 0.05). In the patient group alone, Hopkins Symptom Check List subscale and total scores were significantly higher in the smoker group than in the non-smoker group (p < 0.05). A multivariate regression analysis showed that the Japanese Adult Reading Test score was a significant and negative predictor for smoking (p < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.97; 95% confidence interval: 0.96–0.99). Conclusion Our results suggest that lower estimated premorbid intelligence quotient is an important variable in elucidating smoking behavior in humans and may be associated with higher prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","7 - 13","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Distress symptom; Education level; Premorbid intelligence quotient; Schizophrenia; Smoking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations. Overall, 45% of the students had experienced at least one sunburn in Denmark, and 60% had experienced one sunburn abroad in the past year. Females had higher odds for sunburns than males. Education and geographical region were associated with sunburn but with opposite trends related for sunburn experienced in Denmark and abroad. Students who had poor dietary habits (only abroad), indulged in binge-drinking, smoked (only in Denmark), and more physical activity (only abroad) had higher odds for having a sunburns. We conclude that sunburn is prevalent among young Danes, especially those travelling abroad. Although we found some associations with demographic factors and health behaviour, there were no evident tendencies, thus indicating that broad population-based campaigning should be the preferred intervention.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:14","2019-02-27 20:57:14","","92 - 97","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cancer prevention; Danish national youth study; Health behaviour; Skin cancer; students; Sunburn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined and discussed the key aspects in the design of economic evaluations on school-based interventions targeting weight-related behaviours among 4–12 year olds. The PubMed and CRD databases (NHS EED) were searched. Grey literature was identified from reference lists and websites of relevant organizations. Full economic evaluations on school-based interventions targeting physical activity, sedentariness, or diet were selected. Key aspects included the objective, audience, intervention, comparator, population, type of analysis, perspective, costs, outcomes, and time horizon. Information was also extracted on measuring and valuing costs and outcomes, linking and extrapolating outcomes, and the maintenance of intervention effects. The 23 included studies reported on cost-effectiveness (CEAs) (N = 12), cost-utility (CUAs) (N = 9), social cost benefit (SCBA) (N = 2), and social return on investment (SROI) (N = 1) analysis. The usual practice comparator was generally not clearly defined. The SROI analysis was the single study that included outcomes in other persons than the child. Healthcare costs (N = 14), productivity costs (N = 4), and costs to the household (N = 3), or education (N = 2) sector were examined. The outcome in trial-based CEAs consisted of a variety of weight-related measures. Seven distinctive models were used to extrapolate health and/or productivity costs. To enhance the usefulness of economic evaluations on school-based lifestyle interventions in allocating public health budgets, transparent reporting on key aspects, broadening the scope of economic evaluations, and standardizing the measurement, valuation, and extrapolation of costs and outcomes should be improved.

To investigate the role of the circadian clock in the regulation of splicing in a cancer progression context at the systems-level, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and compared the rhythmic transcriptional profiles of colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 and SW620, derived from primary and metastatic sites of the same patient, respectively. We identified spliceosome components and splicing factors with cell-specific circadian expression patterns including SRSF1, HNRNPLL, ESRP1, and RBM 8A, as well as altered alternative splicing events and circadian alternative splicing patterns of output genes (e.g., VEGFA, NCAM1, FGFR2, CD44) in our cellular model.

However, the use of blended interventions in routine care is still rare and depends on the acceptance of key health care professionals such as the therapists. Little is yet known about the therapists' perspective on and experiences with blended approaches. The aim of this pilot study was to identify barriers and facilitators, as perceived by psychotherapists, for implementing a blended therapy for depression. Methods Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with five therapists, who were part of the German study arm of the FP7-project E-Compared (www.e-compared.eu). All patients (N = 173) were treated in the context of a registered RCT (DRKS00006866) in which the clinical and cost-effectiveness of BT for depression, consisting of ten internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy modules and six f2f sessions, was compared to the treatment usually provided by general practitioners. To identify barriers and facilitators an interview guide based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF) was developed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis by two independent coders. Results The results revealed 29 barriers and 33 facilitators, which are hindering or enabling factors on the levels of ‘implementation in the health care system’, ‘therapy’, ‘therapists’ and ‘patients’. Key barriers stated by all therapists were ‘Limited customizability and autonomy of decisions concerning blending the therapy’ (number of statements, k = 44); ‘Disease-related contraindications for BT’ (k = 25); ‘Negative affect was caused by burden through technical problems’ (k = 18); ‘Limited number of f2f sessions hindered the therapy process’; and ‘Establishment of therapeutic alliance was burdened by technical issues’ (each k = 15). Key facilitators stated by all therapists were: ‘Patients’ interest, willingness and motivation to participate’ (k = 22); ‘Patients' access to online content between f2f sessions and after therapy end’ (k = 20); ‘Preset structure of IMI-part guided the treatment course of BT’ (k = 18); and ‘Effective help with BT in a short time frame’ (k = 15), as well as ‘Reduction of the treatment gap’ (k = 13). Discussion Therapists supported the implementation of BT for depression. Results indicated the consideration of a wide range of determinants: among others, the possibility of individualizing the treatment; the autonomy of decision making in respect to the ratio and number of online and f2f sessions; the necessity of providing training; the need to develop a concept of embedding BT in the health care system and funding the additional effort; and the use of sophisticated technical solutions.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:58","2019-02-27 20:57:58","","150 - 164","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barriers; Blended therapy; depression; Facilitators; Qualitative study; Therapists' view","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method This qualitative study was conducted with 17 individuals with sickle cell disease aged between 13 and 24 years in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil in March and April 2017. An interview investigated the barriers to self-care practice and the feelings associated with sickle cell disease. Data were transcribed and analyzed according to Bardin's perspective using the following steps: (1) pre-analysis, (2) exploration of the material, and (3) treatment of the results (inference and interpretation). Results Five thematic categories emerged: (1) feelings: anger, sadness, and fear; (2) bullying and stigmatization: challenges regarding walking, speaking, or behaving, as well as patient labels; (3) cognitive factors: doubts related to medication, hydration, heredity and maternity; (4) medication compliance: fear of the side effects suffered and anger triggered by the obligation to use the medication; (5) family issues: complaints of not earning the mothers’ trust to live independently. Conclusion The barriers to self-care in young people with sickle cell disease indicate difficulties related to emotional, behavioral, and environmental aspects. Understanding these factors will favor a better adaptation of youths to the context of sickle cell disease.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:13","2019-02-27 20:57:13","","207 - 212","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anemia; health education; Self-care; sickle cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, delivering monetary benefits and increasing interactions with government officials (elected and appointed) may increase trust. On the other hand, it can be difficult for citizens to know to whom to attribute a program and reward with greater trust. Further, imposing paternalistic conditions and possibly prompting citizens to experience feelings of social stigma or guilt, could reduce trust. We answer this question by exploiting the randomized introduction of a locally-managed transfer program in Tanzania in 2010. Our analysis reveals that cash transfers can significantly increase trust in leaders. This effect is driven by large increases in trust in elected leaders as opposed to appointed bureaucrats. Perceptions of government responsiveness to citizens’ concerns and honesty of leaders also rise, and these improvements are largest where there are more village meetings at baseline. One of the central roles of village meetings is to receive and share information with village residents, providing some evidence on the value of a high-information environment for generating trust in government. We also find that records from school and health committees are more readily available in treatment villages. Notably, while stated willingness of citizens to participate in community development projects rises, actual participation in projects and the likelihood of voting do not. Overall, the results suggest little reason to worry that local management of a conditional cash transfer program reduces trust in government or the quality of governance—especially in high-information settings.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","138 - 155","","","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community meetings; Conditional cash transfers; Decentralization; Information; Service delivery; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The DBQ was administered to a sample of 1126 drivers, 50.30% of whom were female. Results are contrary to previous studies: factor analysis showed three pure factors rather than the four factors previously identified. Results also indicate that Qatari drivers share in their approach to driving even though there is great cultural diversity as well as varied language skills and educational levels. Significantly fewer driving aberrations were reported by female participants compared to those who were male. Furthermore, young men (<25 years old) with low levels of education and those who use 4-wheel-drive vehicles had the worst driving errors, violations, and lapses.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:44","2019-02-27 20:57:44","","652 - 659","","","130","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Age cohorts; Arab Gulf; Driving Behavior; road safety; State of Qatar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rural poor rely on subsistence farming, and the consequences of climate events including droughts, floods, and pests have a considerable impact on food security and health. Nationally, 29% of Ugandan children are stunted or below expected height. In this study, we investigated farmers’ experiences of climate events with household food insecurity and child stunting. Methods BRAC Uganda did a cross-sectional study with random sampling across 210 villages in four districts in southwestern Uganda between October and December 2015. Questionnaires on socioeconomics, nutrition, and farming were administered to 7787 smallholder farmers. Anthropometry measurements were taken from the youngest child under 2 years in each household. Stunting, defined as a height-for-age Z-score below −2, was analysed using logistic regression. Food insecurity, self-reported as the number of months without enough food to meet needs, was analysed using multivariate linear regression. Findings Most adults had received only primary-level education and mean monthly income was 332 274 Ugandan Shillings (US$92). In the past 12 months, 6815 (87·8%) farmers experienced a major loss of crops due to drought, 1595 (20·6%) due to flooding, and 7754 (39·1%) due to pests and disease. Food insecurity was reported in 7269 (93·3%) households, for a mean of 4·53 (SD 2·84) out of 12 months. Anthropometric data were collected from 2177 children with a mean age of 11·6 months. 899 were stunted (41·3%). Households with drought-related crop loss had higher odds of child stunting (OR 1·38, 95% CI 1·01–1·89) than households with no crop loss, after controlling for food insecurity, income, education, the child's sex, and age. Food insecurity was significantly associated with crop loss due to drought (p<0·001) and pests (p<0·001), after controlling for covariates. Interestingly, household coping behaviours after pest-related crop loss changed the pest loss effects, which suggests farmers could influence food insecurity. Interpretation As climate patterns shift in Uganda, smallholder farmers will continue to experience events like drought, flooding, and pests. In our study, most farmers’ food security was affected by drought and pests, and droughts were linked to child stunting. These findings have implications in building resiliency in crops and farmer techniques to mitigate climate shocks.

A majority of those with MDD are at high risk for recurrence and increased risk for morbidity and mortality. This study examined whether multimodal baseline (and retest) Cognitive Control performance and neuroimaging markers (task activation and neural connectivity between key brain nodes) could differentiate between those with and without future recurrence of a major depressive (MD) episode within one year. We hypothesized that performance and neuroimaging measures of Cognitive Control would identify markers that differ between these two groups. Methods A prospective cohort study of young adults (ages 18–23) with history (h) of early-onset MDD (N = 60), now remitted, and healthy young adults (N = 49). Baseline Cognitive Control measures of performance, task fMRI and resting state connectivity (and reliability retest 4–12 weeks later) were used to compare those with future recurrence of MDD (N = 21) relative to those without future recurrence of MDD (N = 34 with resilience). The measures tested were (1) Parametric Go/No-Go (PGNG) performance, and task activation for (2) PGNG Correct Rejections, (3) PGNG Commission errors, and (4 & 5), resting state connectivity analyses of Cognitive Control Network to and from subgenual anterior cingulate. Results Relative to other groups at baseline, the group with MDD Recurrence had less bilateral middle frontal gyrus activation during commission errors. MDD Recurrence exhibited greater connectivity of right middle frontal gyrus to subgenual anterior cingulate (SGAC). SGAC connectivity was also elevated in this group to numerous regions in the Cognitive Control Network. Moderate to strong ICCs were present from test to retest, and highest for rs-fMRI markers. There were modest, significant correlations between task, connectivity and behavioral markers that distinguished between groups. Conclusion Markers of Cognitive Control function could identify those with early course MD who are at risk for depression recurrence. Those at high risk for recurrence would benefit from maintenance or preventative treatments. Future studies could test and validate these markers as potential predictors, accounting for sample selection and bias in feature detection.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:59","2019-02-27 20:57:59","","1001 - 1009","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives This study aimed to investigate the consumers’ preferences concerning the selection of pharmacy and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and to identify customer segments in relation to these preferences. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2016 on a convenient quota sample of 300 participants recruited in the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. The main instrument used for data collection was a structured questionnaire with close-ended, multiple choice questions. To identify customer segments, Two-Step cluster analysis was conducted. Results Three distinct pharmacy customer clusters emerged. Customers of the largest cluster (49%; ‘convenience customers’) were mostly younger consumers. They gave moderate to positive ratings to factors affecting the selection of pharmacy and OTCs; convenience, and previous experience and the pharmacist’s opinion, received the highest ratings. Customers of the second cluster (35%; ‘loyal customers’) were mainly retired; most of them reported visiting a single pharmacy. They gave high ratings to all factors that influence pharmacy selection, especially the pharmacy’s staff, and factors influencing the purchase of OTCs, particularly previous experience and the pharmacist’s opinion. Customers of the smallest cluster (16%; ‘convenience and price-sensitive customers’) were mainly retired or unemployed with low to moderate education, and low personal income. They gave the lowest ratings to most of the examined factors; convenience among factors influencing pharmacy selection, whereas previous experience, the pharmacist’s opinion and product price among those affecting the purchase of OTCs, received the highest ratings. Conclusions The community pharmacy market comprised of distinct customer segments that varied in the consumer preferences concerning the selection of pharmacy and OTCs, the evaluation of pharmaceutical services and products, and demographic characteristics.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:04","2019-02-27 20:57:04","","33 - 43","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cluster analysis; Consumer behavior; Customer segmentation; OTCs’ purchase; Pharmacy customers’ profiles; Pharmacy selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Project activities were planned according to the step-by-step coalition-based prevention system, Communities That Care. Methods During Year 1 (2013/2014), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 community members (parents, school administrators and teachers, and community leaders and volunteers) to evaluate readiness to adopt Communities That Care. Participants were asked to (1) define community; (2) identify community strengths; (3) recommend methods to strengthen community relationships; (4) envision ideal coalition functions; (5) identify current community resources; (6) recommend prevention targets and methods; (7) identify potential barriers to coalition participation; and (8) assess overall community readiness to adopt Communities That Care. Analyses were conducted in Year 3 (2015/2016). Results Participants expressed eagerness and readiness to adopt Communities That Care. They identified community strengths and local resources that could contribute to coalition success, as well as potential barriers to participation and group cohesion that if left unaddressed could diminish coalition impact. Participants believed that links between multiple environments (home, school, community) should be strengthened in order to promote the well-being of youth. They envisioned the Communities That Care coalition as a task force of community members with varying talents invested in youth across their entire life course. Conclusions Community members’ insights may be used to guide implementation of Communities That Care by this coalition and others.

A descriptive analysis, t-test, ANOVA, and post hoc comparison were performed for quantitative data analysis while qualitative data quoting students' elaboration on their responses were presented. This study reached three main conclusions. First, there is a significant difference between the risk perception scores of oral intake PHBs compared to physical contact PHBs. Second, the risk perception scores between this study and the American survey differ significantly. Furthermore, 13 of the items are considered to be socioculturally-embedded PHBs, differing substantially between the two study populations. Therefore, this study suggests that, in order to promote health policy and education, biology, society and culture levels need to be considered.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","e00839","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education; psychology; Public health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work explores the effect of a range of grading methodologies on the energy absorbing and damping behaviour of flexible TPU honeycomb structures. By applying density grading, the energy absorbing and damping profiles are significantly modified from the uniform density equivalent. A 3D-printing procedure was developed which allowed the manufacture of high-quality structures, which underwent cyclic loading to densification without failure. Graded honeycomb architectures had an average relative density of 0.375 ± 0.05. After quasi-static testing, arrays were subjected to sinusoidal compression over a range of amplitudes at 0.5 Hz. By grading the structural density in different ways, mechanical damping was modified. Cyclic compressive testing also showed how strain-softening of the TPU parent material could lead to reduced damping over the course of 50 cycles. Samples were subjected to impact loading at strain-rates of up to 51 s-1 and specific impact energies of up to 270 mJ/cm3. Lower peak loads were transferred for graded samples for the most severe impact cases. This behaviour reveals the potential of density grading of TPU structures to provide superior impact protection in extreme environmental conditions.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","130 - 142","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additive manufacturing; Cellular structures; Functional grading; Thermoplastic polyurethane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods This study was conducted on women who participated in free preconception check-ups provided by the Zhabei District Maternity and Child Care Center in Shanghai, China. The information regarding the female demographic characteristics, physical condition, history of pregnancy and childbearing, diet and behavior, and social psychological factors was collected, and TCM constitution assessment was performed. The Chi-square test, t-test, logistic regression analysis, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to explore the related factors of TCM constitution. Results The participants in this study were aged 28.3 ± 3.0 years. Approximately fifty-five women in this study had Unbalanced Constitution. Logistic regression analysis showed that Shanghai residence, dysmenorrhea, gum bleeding, aversion to vegetables, preference for raw meat, job stress, and economic stress were significantly and negatively associated with Balanced Constitution. Multinomial logistic analysis showed that Shanghai residence was significantly associated with Yang-deficiency, Yin-deficiency, and Stagnant Qi Constitutions; gum bleeding was significantly associated with Yin-deficiency, Stagnant Blood, Stagnant Qi, and Inherited Special Constitutions; aversion to vegetables was significantly associated with Damp-heat Constitution; job stress was significantly associated with Yang-deficiency, Phlegm-dampness, Damp-heat, Stagnant Blood, and Stagnant Qi Constitutions; and economic stress was significantly associated with Yang-deficiency, and Stagnant Qi Constitutions. Conclusion The application of TCM constitution to preconception care would be beneficial for early identification of potential TCM constitution risks and be beneficial for early intervention (e.g., health education, and dietary education), especially during the women who do not have a medical condition and those who have related factors found in this study.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:22","2019-02-27 20:57:22","","358 - 365","","4","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Body constitution; Chinese traditional medicine; Preconception care; Risk factors; Women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has found cannabis-vaping (i.e., vape-pen use) is associated with lower perceived risks and higher cannabis use. Knowledge of these products may increase likelihood of subsequent use. As policies for cannabis shift, beliefs that peers and family approve of this substance use (injunctive norms) increase and there has been an increase in vape-pen use among young adults (18–35year olds); however, correlates thereof remain unknown. Young adults often engage in cross-substance use with cannabis and alcohol, making alcohol a potential correlate of cannabis vape-pen use and knowledge. Therefore, we examined alcohol use and other potential correlates of vape-pen use and knowledge among a sample of university students. Methods This secondary data analysis utilized surveys at multiple colleges in the U.S. (N=270). Alcohol use, social anxiety, cannabis expectancies, injunctive and descriptive norms and facets of impulsivity were examined as correlates of vape-pen use and knowledge using bivariate correlations and logistic regressions. Results Alcohol use was correlated with cannabis vape-pen use and knowledge. Frequency of cannabis use, peer injunctive norms, and positive expectancies were associated with increased likelihood of vape-pen use. Lack of premeditation, a facet of impulsivity, was associated with cannabis vape-pen knowledge. Conclusions Given the unknown nature and consequences of cannabis vape-pens, the present findings offer valuable information on correlates of this behavior.

Correlates of such behavior remain to be clarified. We assessed school, out-of-school and family correlates of compliance with physical activity (PA) recommendations during weekdays among weekend non-compliant youth in Switzerland. Cross-sectional data collected in 2013–2015 from the SOPHYA study. PA was objectively measured during one week using waist-worn accelerometers. Compliance with PA recommendations (≥60min/day of moderate-to-vigorous PA) was assessed separately for weekend and weekdays. Data on school sport, transport to school, sports club participation, household income, parent's PA and education were collected by phone interview and questionnaires. Data from 540 youth (316 girls) aged 6–16years were available for analysis. Participants who were compliant to recommendations during weekdays were more frequently boys (50.3% vs. 31.4%, p<0.001), more often participated in sports club (73.3% vs. 64.3%, p=0.024), and were more prone to adopt active transport to school (75.8% vs. 62.0%, p=0.001) than non-compliers. Multivariable adjustment showed male gender [odds ratio and (95% confidence interval): 4.30 (2.71–6.81)], sports club participation [1.91 (1.21–3.02)], and PA-active parent [1.98 (1.20–3.28)] were significantly associated with weekday compliance. Being a male, a sports club participant and having a physically active parent significantly increase compliance with PA recommendations during weekdays among Swiss youth who are inactive on weekends.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:13","2019-02-27 20:57:13","","86 - 91","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; Correlates; physical activity; Sports club; Week; youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data includes all instruments used, SPSS syntax, the raw survey data and descriptive statistics from the analyses. Raw data was entered into SPSS software and scrubbed using appropriate techniques in order to prepare the data for analysis. We believe that our dataset and instrument may give important insights related to computers in human behavior, and predicting trust antecedents in social media use such as age, gender, number of hour online and choice of content provider. We have also created a parsimonious five factor trust instrument developed from the extant literature for future research. Hence, this newly developed trust instrument can be used to measure trust not only in social media, but also in other areas such as healthcare, economics and investor relations, CSR, management and education. Moreover, the survey items developed to measure social media use are concise and may be applied to measure social media use in other contexts such as national cultural differences, marketing and tourism. For interpretation and discussion of the data and constructs, please see original article entitled “Who trusts social media” (Warner-Søderholm et al., 2018) [1].","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:57","2019-02-27 20:57:57","","696 - 699","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Método Estudio mixto, cuantitativo, observacional, de corte transversal correlacional y cualitativo. Una muestra cuantitativa de 289 personas de Temuco (Chile) contestó a un cuestionario sobre categorías sociales y su percepción de la gravedad de 15 conductas como delito. Para la fase cualitativa se realizaron 12 entrevistas semiestandarizadas sometidas a análisis de contenido, incorporando algunos elementos de la teoría fundamentada desde la perspectiva constructivista. Resultados Con independencia del sexo, más de la mitad de la muestra de estudio consideran el aborto como un delito entre grave y extremadamente grave. Las personas religiosas, sin importar el tipo de religión, políticamente conservadoras y con menor nivel educativo, presentan una percepción del aborto como delito de mayor gravedad. La participación con frecuencia en actos religiosos presenta un efecto mediador. Los resultados cualitativos establecen una perspectiva multidimensional y el dogma de la religión como argumento central para rechazar el aborto. Conclusiones La religión y una visión política conservadora afectan las construcciones tradicionales de género y maternidad, y por ende se observa una tendencia a rechazar el aborto. Estos resultados hacen hincapié en la necesidad de prestar especial atención a la aceptación de la Ley 21.030 sobre la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo para una aplicación efectiva. Objective To identify the variables and the axiological argumentations that configure the perception of abortion as a crime, in a sample of a city in southern Chile during the debate of law 21.030. Method The design is quantitative, observational correlation cross-sectional followed by a qualitative approach. The quantitative sample of 289 members of the community of Temuco (Chile) answered a questionnaire about social categories, and their perception of the seriousness of 15 behaviours defined in Chile as crimes. For the qualitative phase, we carried out 12 semi-standardized interviews in the same community, subject to content analysis, incorporating some elements of grounded theory from the constructivist perspective. Results Regardless of sex, more than half of the study sample considers abortion to be between a serious and an extremely serious crime, despite its current decriminalization. Religious people, no matter what kind of religion, political conservatives and people of a lower educational level, perceive abortion as a serious crime. Frequency of participation in religious events has a mediating effect. The qualitative results establish t religious teaching as a very important argument to reject abortion, and that the perception of the severity of abortion as a crime is multidimensional. Conclusion Religion and a conservative political vision affect the traditional constructions of gender and motherhood, and therefore, there is a marked tendency to reject abortion. These results emphasize the need to pay special attention to the acceptance of Law 21.030 on the voluntary termination of pregnancy in regions. This is important for effective application of the Law.","2018","2019-02-27 20:58:02","2019-02-27 20:58:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Abortion; Aborto; Educational level; Escolaridad; Impression of severity; Percepción; Perception; Política; Politics; Religión; Religion; Sensación de gravedad","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Affected macaques display progressive neurological deficits including visual impairment, tremor, incoordination, ataxia and impaired balance. Imaging, functional and pathological studies revealed that CLN7−/− macaques have reduced retinal thickness and retinal function early in disease, followed by profound cerebral and cerebellar atrophy that progresses over a five to six-year disease course. Histological analyses showed an accumulation of cerebral, cerebellar and cardiac storage material as well as degeneration of neurons, white matter fragmentation and reactive gliosis throughout the brain of affected animals. This novel CLN7−/− macaque model recapitulates key behavioral and neuropathological features of human Batten Disease and provides novel insights into the pathophysiology linked to CLN7 mutations. These animals will be invaluable for evaluating promising therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.","2018","2019-02-27 20:58:02","2019-02-27 20:58:02","","65 - 78","","","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Batten disease; CLN7; Japanese macaque; Large animal model; Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; Lysosomal storage disease; MFSD8; Neurodegeneration; Non-human primate; Retinal degeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A metabolic score was generated by determining pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, key enzymes of glycolysis, ex vivo in primary CLL samples under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This score was further correlated with clinical endpoints and response to CIT in 96 CLL patients. 45 patients were classified as metabolic high risk (HR), 51 as low risk (LR). Treatment-free survival (TFS) was significantly shorter in HR patients (median 394 vs 723 days, p = .021). 15 HR patients and 14 LR patients received CIT after sample acquisition.

Major risk factors for most CHDs, particularly those resulting from the combination of environmental exposures with social determinants and behaviors, are still unknown. This study evaluated the main effect of maternal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and its interaction with social-demographics and environmental factors on CHDs in China. A population-based, matched case-control study of 9452 live-born infants and stillborn fetuses was conducted using the Guangdong Registry of Congenital Heart Disease data (2004–2014). The CHDs were evaluated by obstetrician, pediatrician, or cardiologist, and confirmed by cardia tomography/catheterization. Controls were randomly chosen from singleton newborns without any malformation, born in the same hospital as the cases and 1:1 matched by infant sex, time of conception, and parental residence (same city and town to ensure sufficient geographical distribution for analyses). Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect information on demographics, behavior patterns, maternal disease/medication, and environmental exposures. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ETS exposure on CHDs while controlling for all risk factors. Interactive effects were evaluated using a multivariate delta method for maternal demographics, behavior, and environmental exposures on the ETS-CHD relationship. Mothers exposed to ETS during the first trimester of pregnancy were more likely to have infants with CHD than mothers who did not (aOR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.25–1.66). We also observed a significant dose-response relationship when mothers were exposed to ETS and an increasing number of risk factors and CHDs. There were greater than additive interactions for maternal ETS and migrant status, low household income and paternal alcohol consumption on CHDs. Maternal low education also modified the ETS-CHD association on the multiplicative scale. These findings may help to identify high-risk populations for CHD, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:44","2019-02-27 20:57:44","","214 - 222","","","234","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Congenital; Environment; Heart defects; interaction; Tobacco smoke","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms. We aimed to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing interventions for ASD in preschool-aged children. Electronic databases were searched for related articles with randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs published between 2001 to 2015. Outcome measures were communication, behavioural and cognitive skills, reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) compared to a control group. A Random-effects model was utilised to calculate the pooled estimate effect. Between-study variability was also assessed. The registering number of this study is CRD42017035354. Findings Out of the initial 5174 studies that were identified, there were 14 RCTs (746 children) that were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimate effect provided by random-effects model was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.08–0.37]) with no between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, p = 0.0018). Three studies of music therapy interventions provided the greatest outcome effects with a shorter duration and lower intensity. SMD for music therapies ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 with 95% CI [0.22 to 1.85]. The quality of the health care provider, the duration, and the intensity of intervention played an important role in the effectiveness of the intervention. Interpretation Music therapy appears to be an effective tool for improving social interaction in preschool-aged children with ASD. However, more evidence-based trials are required to further validate the effectiveness of music therapy in ASD.","2018","2019-02-27 20:56:56","2019-02-27 20:56:56","","e00763","","9","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education; Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These responses might have important implications for human and economic development, women's empowerment, and environmental sustainability. However, to date, few studies have explored the associations between climate change and fertility intentions, family planning use, and births. Methods Drawing on the literature linking climate variability to rice production in Indonesia, we used large-scale, longitudinal household survey data and high-resolution climate data to explore changes in childbearing preferences, family planning use, and births after community-level climate anomalies (timing of monsoon onset and temperature) in Indonesia between 1993 and 2015. Analyses were done with a series of fixed-effects, logistic regression models. We also assessed parallel shifts in household wellbeing, as measured by expenditure on rice, food, and non-food products. Findings We found that, in the short term (climate anomalies occurring 1–12 months before surveys), fertility desires increased and family planning use declined in response to delays in monsoon onset, particularly in wealthier populations. Delays in monsoon onset were also associated with substantially reduced expenditure on food and non-food products among households without farm businesses and high levels of education. In the medium term (climate anomalies occurring 1–60 months before surveys), fertility desires declined and family planning use increased in response to high temperatures, particularly in poorer populations. Interpretation These results suggest that fertility desires, family planning use, and births are affected by climate shocks. Provision of high-quality family planning services can serve as an important climate change adaptation tool for vulnerable populations.

However, the curative effect of manipulation differs among researchers, and its necessity remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to confirm the efficacy of manipulation using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods A total of 61 TMD patients who had mouth-opening limitation (upper and lower middle incisor distance ≤35mm) were selected. They were divided into two treatment groups: conventional treatment (n=30) and conventional treatment plus manipulation (n=31). The conventional treatment included two types of self-exercise: cognitive behavioral therapy for bruxism and education. Mouth-opening limitation, orofacial pain, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sounds were recorded from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline. These parameters were statistically compared between the two treatment groups by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe’s test to assess mouth opening distance and pain; TMJ sounds were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Results No statistical difference was observed between the two treatment groups except for mouth-opening limitation after treatment at the first visit. Subgroup analyses, stratified according to the pathological type of TMD, indicated a similar trend. Conclusions The efficacy of manipulation seems to be limited, in contrast to our expectations, and improved execution of therapeutic exercises has a similar effect to that of manipulation during long-term observation. The advantage of manipulation was observed only during the first treatment session. The RCT was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network in Japan (UMIN-CTR: 000010437).","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:48","2019-02-27 20:57:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); exercise; Manipulation; Randomized controlled trial (RCT); Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motorcycle accidents involving young people are particularly common, and there are various issues concerning traffic safety. To understand the situation in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, we conducted a questionnaire survey on driving attitude and behavior of motorcycle users targeted at high school and college students and a video observation survey of motorcycle driving conditions. Based on the survey analysis results, we held a traffic safety workshop (WS) comprising practical skills and classroom learning centered on hazard anticipation. In this study, we conducted a statistical comparative analysis of driving behavior frequency on non-intersection intervals of arterial roads before and after the WS, based on observational results from video cameras mounted on motorcycles. The results showed that the WS effects were associated with a reduction in average travel speeds and changes in driving behavior, such as frequency of lane changing. Different responses to the WS were observed according to attributes, and thus, the relationship between the content of this kind of traffic safety WS and behavioral changes needs to be clarified and a more advanced traffic safety WS program developed.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","171 - 179","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hazard perception; Motorcycle; Traffic behavior; Traffic education; Traffic safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated a new, brief POI for depression and conducted exploratory moderator analyses. Methods In this online trial (German Clinical Trials Register; DRKS00011045), we allocated participants to treatment as usual (TAU; n = 67) or POI (n = 65). At first, we randomized participants; later we allocated participants based on depression severity in order to counter baseline differences. The unguided POI addressed behavioral activation and depressive thinking in a single module with 25 webpages (including a smartphone application). We did one assessment at baseline and a post-assessment four weeks later. Results At post-assessment, depression (p = .586), behavioral activation (p = .332), and dysfunctional attitudes (p = .499) did not differ between groups. When concurrent treatments (medication/psychotherapy) remained constant/decreased, the POI outperformed TAU (p = .031). POI-participants with lower willingness to change (p = .030) or higher education (p = .017) were less likely to worsen (i.e., experience increased depressive symptoms) compared to TAU. Discussion The targeted sample size was not reached, measurements were self-reported, and randomization failed. The POI's content may have been too limited. Concurrent treatments, which were more often sought out by TAU participants, diminished group differences and should be considered in future studies. Brief POIs may protect against worsening of depressive symptoms among highly educated participants or those with low willingness to change.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:24","2019-02-27 20:57:24","","73 - 81","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioral activation; Cognitive restructuring; depression; Moderator analysis; Psychological online intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, only little is known about their actual link. Egocentric social network analysis (SNA) allows one to gather data about where and with whom individuals undertake their social activities. SNA therefore provides a way to study socially motivated leisure travel. This paper presents a data collection effort in the canton of Zürich, Switzerland, which combines a mobility survey with a name generator and interpreter to gather information about individuals’ egocentric social networks. A higher number of contacts leads to a higher response burden, which in turn increases item non-response. Subjects with low income and education generally name fewer contacts. With regards to travel behavior, the frequency of face-to-face meetings decreases sharply with distance to the residential location of contacts and face-to-face meetings are generally not substituted by other modes of communication (although increased usage of video chat is observed at long distances). Distance to social contacts is, therefore, an important factor in social leisure travel.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","99 - 109","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","egocentric social network analysis; leisure travel; mobility survey; name generator; social network; social network analysis; transport survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor team behaviors negatively affect team performance and are associated with adverse events and worse outcomes. Interventions to improve surgical teamwork focusing on frontline team members’ nontechnical skills have proliferated but shown mixed results. Literature on teamwork in organizations suggests that team behaviors are also contingent on psychosocial, cultural, and organizational factors. This study examined factors influencing surgical team behaviors to inform more contextually sensitive and effective approaches to optimizing surgical teamwork. Methods This qualitative study of cardiac surgical teams in a large United States teaching hospital included 34 semistructured interviews. Thematic network analysis was used to examine perceptions of ideal teamwork and factors influencing team behaviors in the operating room. Results Perceptions of ideal teamwork were largely shared, but team members held discrepant views of which team and leadership behaviors enhanced or undermined teamwork. Other factors affecting team behaviors were related to the local organizational culture, including management of staff behavior, variable case demands, and team members’ technical competence, and fitness of organizational structures and processes to support teamwork. These factors affected perceptions of what constituted optimal interpersonal and team behaviors in the operating room. Conclusions Team behaviors are contextually contingent and organizationally determined, and beliefs about optimal behaviors are not necessarily shared. Interventions to optimize surgical teamwork require establishing consensus regarding best practice, ability to adapt as circumstances require, and organizational commitment to addressing contextual factors that affect teams.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:48","2019-02-27 20:57:48","","115 - 120","","1","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With 427 kg of food wasted per capita per year, the country ranks among the top food wasters. Ironically, the Kingdom has limited arable lands and scarce water resources to support mass-scale agriculture and to feed its increasing population, KSA relies heavily on imports and subsidized food to meet needs. Yet, food is wasted at restaurants, caterers, cafeterias and, especially, by households such that food waste is the single-largest component of the landfills. The review article is based on the grey and scientific literature published in the English and Arabic languages on the issue of food waste in Saudi Arabia. Information sources like Web of knowledge, online resources and the databases available through the King Saud University, Saudi Arabia were accessed and used to collect information on food waste, its social, cultural, economic and environmental impacts and related topics. Since food items and groceries are abundantly available to all living in KSA and they are highly subsidized, the residents take food for granted. According to a recent survey, about 78% of food purchased in KSA is discarded each week in order to make room for new groceries. The factors responsible for food waste include: lack of awareness; and insufficient and inappropriate planning when shopping. Food waste in restaurants, celebrations, social events and occasions are enormous. Waste is common in festivals and special events where the customs is to provide more food than required. There is a need to change society’s food culture, particularly among the women and the youth, as they are largest segment of the society and the prime food wasters. The analysis of the factors responsible for food waste, identified in this article suggests a “Stop Wasting Food” campaign should be launched. It is also recommended to determine and activate the role of extension education to reduce food waste in the KSA through vibrant capacity building programs for youth and women, in particular, and society in general.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:45","2019-02-27 20:57:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","behavioral change; Economic losses; Environmental pollution; Extension education; Food security; Food waste; Natural resources; Sustainability issues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unknown whether these effects persist into later adolescence or adulthood, and little is known about whether gardening in later adolescence is related to F/V intake. Objective To identify the relationship between both childhood and recent (within the past 12 months) gardening experiences and current F/V intake among college students. Design/participants A cross-sectional evaluation of 1,121 college freshmen with suboptimal F/V consumption from eight US universities. Main outcome measures Participants completed the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable Screener and questions about gardening experiences. Respondents were grouped as having gardened or not gardened during childhood and recently. Statistical analyses performed A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the relationship between childhood and recent gardening and current F/V intake. Results Of the student participants, 11% reported gardening only during childhood, 19% reported gardening only recently, 20% reported gardening both as a child and recently, and 49% of students reported never having gardened. Students who gardened both during childhood and recently had a significantly higher mean current intake of F/V compared with students who never gardened (2.5±0.6 vs 1.9±0.5 cup equivalents [CE], respectively; P<0.001). In addition, F/V intake increased with frequency of recent gardening engagement when comparing students who did not garden with those who gardened monthly or weekly (2.1±0.5 CE, 2.4±0.6 CE, and 2.8±0.7 CE, respectively; P<0.001). Conclusions This analysis suggests that the combination of childhood and recent gardening experience is associated with greater current F/V intake among first-year college students not currently meeting national F/V recommendations. In addition, a greater frequency of gardening experience may further enhance this effect.","2018","2019-02-27 20:58:03","2019-02-27 20:58:03","","275 - 283","","2","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Childhood; college students; Fruit and vegetable intake; Gardening; Gardening frequency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This, coupled with rapid economic and population growth, is believed to have contributed to the rapid growth in domestic energy demand and, recently, affected the government budget in the face of low international oil prices. In December 2015, Saudi Arabia announced increases in domestic energy prices. This paper therefore considers the impacts, focusing on gasoline, by estimating a demand function and using it to estimate the change in social welfare. Gasoline demand is found to be price inelastic suggesting that it may be difficult for the Saudi government to limit future growth in gasoline consumption using only increases in the administered price of gasoline. Thus, limiting future gasoline consumption in the KSA might require improved energy efficiency of passenger cars, increased energy awareness by drivers through education and marketing campaigns, and the provision of alternative transport modes within cities. Although the announced gasoline price increase is not expected to reduce demand considerably, it can deliver estimated welfare increases of up to 1.66 billion 2010 US$ ( 6.23 billion 2010 Saudi Arabian Riyals), which is around 0.26% of Saudi gross domestic product.","2018","2019-02-27 20:56:48","2019-02-27 20:56:48","","123 - 133","","","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gasoline Demand; Saudi Arabia; Structural Time Series Model; Subsidies; Underlying Energy Demand Trend; Welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study is based on 6548 women and men who participated in the WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health conducted in six states in India during 2007–08. Multilevel ordinary least square regression was used to examine the gender difference in cognitive health, adjusting for individual, household, health behavior and state-level variables. A composite cognitive score (CCS) was calculated by combining z-scores of five individual cognitive tests. Results suggest that CCS is worse among women than among men after adjusting for individual and state level factors. The largest reduction in the gender gap in CCS was observed when adjusting for education, followed by other individual factors such as marital status, individual height, caste, religion, tobacco consumption and chronic health status. Although state level urbanization and female workforce participation rate were significantly associated with CCS, these characteristics did not contribute to the reduction of gender difference in CCS. This study extends the current knowledge of women’s disadvantage in cognitive health, demonstrating that individual level characteristics remain key determinants of gender difference in cognition among older adults in India. Importantly, this relationship holds in the context of very large cross-state variations in cognitive health and its determinants.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:14","2019-02-27 20:57:14","","180 - 187","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive health; gender; India; Multilevel analysis; Regional disparities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was designed to obtain information from patients attending outpatient clinics of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Of the 553 self-reported questionnaires, 519 were filled comprising 251 males and 268 females. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: six demographic questions and 25 questions assessing oral health beliefs and behaviors. The statistical analysis was done using frequency distribution and chi square tests. Results Comparing males with females, there was no significant gender difference in beliefs. However, when it comes to behaviors, females were found to act more positively than males in many assessed oral health aspects of the study. When comparing beliefs versus behaviors towards the importance of oral health styles, a gap of 12–45% was noted between those “who believe of oral health behaviors” and those “who actually practiced them”. Conclusions The study presented valuable information about the differences between beliefs and behaviors of Saudi population. It also indicated that females in general, acted more positively toward oral health than males. Health care providers might need to focus more on the improvement of oral health behaviors and practices especially among males. The real reasons for lack of behaviors need further investigation. Furthermore, oral health campaigns should switch focus from people’s education to oral health practices and actions.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:13","2019-02-27 20:57:13","","226 - 231","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","behavior; Belief; gender; health; Oral; Specific","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genetic effects on self-esteem were robust, and the same genes were responsible for the stability of self-esteem in individuals over time. Nearly half of the variance in self-esteem was explained by a new genetic factor arising during the decade, suggesting that genetic innovation of self-esteem occurred in early adult life. The genetic and environmental covariance structure between personality and self-esteem in individuals was constant over a decade, providing evidence that the stability of self-esteem was largely attributable to personality. However, genetics for self-esteem independent of personality still contributed to stability over time, differentiating the concept of self-esteem from personality as a trait in terms of its genetic and environmental etiological levels.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:58","2019-02-27 20:57:58","","140 - 146","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioral genetics; Genetic innovation; longitudinal study; personality; Self-esteem; Twin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite significant progress to meet patient need, current breast cancer (BC) policies fail to recognize the unique challenges of patients who are further along the cancer patient journey. This analysis aims to understand BC/mBC policy development at a global level and identify opportunities for further development. A comprehensive analysis of National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs) policies and programs was conducted across 16 countries, which represent a diverse range of healthcare systems, economies and geographic regions. Examples of promising practices, implemented or initiated by civil society, are provided to demonstrate successful methods to address the identified policy gaps. The analysis finds that disparities in BC policy development exist across and within countries. Progress in BC policy is fragmented and skewed towards the early part of the patient journey e.g. awareness and stakeholder education, with key gaps remaining in diagnosis and patient identification. In addition, access to innovative mBC treatments, ongoing support and palliative care remain a challenge, while care coordination is limited due to inefficient referrals. Although government and policymaker action is fundamental, collaboration between different stakeholders is imperative to address unmet needs of BC/mBC patients alike. Policy initiatives and promising practices that demonstrate successful multi-stakeholder engagement can be replicated or used to inform further advocacy and policy development with the aim to address patient unmet needs.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:45","2019-02-27 20:57:45","","93 - 106","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advocacy; Breast cancer; Implementation; Metastatic breast cancer; National cancer control plan; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the LAMC3 gene have recently been shown to cause complex bilateral occipital cortical gyration abnormalities. However, to what extent these structural changes impact visual behavior is not known. We recorded responses for two screening test batteries targeting visual function (Leuven - Perceptual Organization Screening Test, Cortical Vision Screening Test) and measured eye fixation performance in a visual attention experiment from a patient with homozygous LAMC3 gene mutation. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) we quantitatively assessed the extent of structural changes brought on by the genetic mutation by comparing mean cortical curvature, cortical thickness, and gray matter volume in 34 cortical areas between patient and an age-, sex-, and education-matched control group. Anatomical connectivity between these cortical areas was investigated by a structural covariance analysis. Visual screening-, and behavioral results revealed that the patient's impairments were predominantly in visuo-spatial attention. Consistent with this, VBM and structural connectivity results revealed significant structural changes in cortical regions subserving attentional functions. We conclude that the LAMC3 gene mutation affects cortical areas beyond the occipital lobe and primarily those visual functions that involve heavily distributed networks – such as visuo-spatial attention.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:13","2019-02-27 20:57:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cortical organization; LAMC3 mutation; Structural covariance analysis; Visuo-spatial attention; Voxel-based morphometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In remedy, we studied 65 traditional neighborhoods and 77 formally-organized CBRM groups across four ecological zones and investigated how and when CBRM obtains greater social outcomes than non-CBRM neighborhoods. We measured pastoralists’ social capital, rangeland management practices, and behavior using a mixed-methods approach including qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative questionnaires of 706 herder households. We applied a conditional process analysis method, novel to CBRM studies, to investigate potential mechanisms by which CBRM affects social outcomes. CBRM members used significantly more information sources, had stronger leadership, more opportunities for knowledge exchange, and rules for resource use, which were significantly associated with greater social outcomes including the use of traditional and innovative rangeland and herd management practices, proactive behavior, and social networking. Access to diverse information sources emerged as an important variable related to strong local leadership, knowledge exchange, and setting rules for rangeland use. Ecological context had a strong association with the level of CBRM social outcomes achieved through this process. The statistical effect of CBRM, mediated by information, leadership, knowledge exchange, and rules, was significantly greater on proactive behaviors of desert steppe herders compared to herders in non-desert steppe zones. Further, CBRM mediated by the same four variables, was associated with higher social networking among herders in the mountain and forest steppe, steppe, and desert steppe but not in the eastern steppe. Our findings suggest why CBRM outcomes have been mixed in Mongolia and elsewhere, and point to the importance of accounting for local context in facilitating development of pastoral institutions. Policies to support CBRM should consider prioritizing resource users’ access to diverse information, leadership development, and involvement in elaborating community rules for resource management and local forums for information exchange.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","93 - 104","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","collaborative conservation; common pool resources; community-based natural resource management; conditional process analysis; conservation effects assessment; extensive livestock production; Mongolia; pastoral institutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent such incidents, we assessed the causative factors of these incidents. Methods The Anaphylaxis Working Group of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology requested that society members register cases in which adrenaline auto-injectors were unintentionally used. One hundred cases were reported from June 2015 to March 2016. We identified the root causes of 70 child and 25 adult cases, separately. Results The incidents occurred with repeated prescriptions as well as the first prescription. Three cases resulted in a failure to administer an adrenaline auto-injector to children with anaphylaxis. Four caregivers used it with improper application (epilepsy or enteritis). Among the child cases, the median age at the time of the incident was 5.5 years (range, 2–14 years). Five children injected the adrenaline auto-injector on their own body trunk. Twenty children were not the allergic patients themselves. Improper management protocol of the device and the child's development were concomitantly involved in most of the cases. A variety of human behaviors were identified as the root causes in the adult cases. At least 34 cases were associated with mix-ups between the actual and training device. Conclusions Health workers should provide sufficient education regarding safety use of adrenaline auto-injector for caregivers tailored to their experience levels at both first and repeated prescriptions. Such education must cover anticipatory behavior based on normal child development. Devices should also be further improved to prevent such incidents.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:56","2019-02-27 20:57:56","","475 - 480","","4","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adrenaline; Adrenaline auto-injector; Anaphylaxis; Food allergy; Root cause analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Thirty people who had participated in a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of a nurse-led complex package of care for gout, were purposively sampled and interviewed between 18–26 months after the end of the trial. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Data were managed using Nvivo. STATA v15 was used to describe summary statistics. Results Participants described their views and experiences of engaging with a nurse-led intervention designed to provide holistic assessment, individualised patient education, and involvement in shared decision-making for the long-term management of gout. The analysis revealed key themes in how nurse-led intervention facilitated engagement with ULT, namely by proving improved knowledge and understanding of gout and its treatment, involvement of patients in decision-making about treatment, and increased confidence about benefits from treatment. However, some treatment uncertainty and concern remained and one participant free of gout flares discontinued ULT, while another halved the dose after the end of the trial. Conclusions This study reports data on patient experience of engaging with ULT to manage gout after receiving nurse-led care. It demonstrates that shared decision-making and the joint efforts of fully informed practitioners and patients persuades patients to engage with ULTs, and that experiencing the benefits of curative treatment motivates them to maintain adherence.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:45","2019-02-27 20:57:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clinical inertia; Gout; Medication adherence; Nurse-led intervention; Therapeutic education; Urate-lowering therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing evidence-based interventions for these people and their caregivers (dyads) is a public health priority, and is highly dependent on recruiting representatives from the community. Precision recruitment methodologies are needed to improve the efficiency of this process. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer the potential to determine location trends of an older adult population of people living with dementia in the community and their caregivers. American Community Survey (ACS) 2015 5-year estimates were analyzed at the census tract level in ESRI ArcMap v. 10.5.1. Datasets included summarized estimates of age, gender, income, and education in Maryland. Using a two-step process including the assessment of population density of individuals aged 65+, catchment areas were defined in ArcMap and compared to participant locations from a previously completed traditional recruitment effort (Dementia Behavior Study - R01AGO41781). The largest number of participants was accounted for by a combination of age, education, gender, and income variables; predicting 184 (79%) participants without accounting for population density. 208 (89%) were identified when matching this variable combination with highly dense population areas, and 66 (28%) in regions with the lowest population density of those aged 65+. This study successfully defined specific geographic regions in the state of Maryland that overlapped with a large number of known dementia dyad locations obtained via traditional recruitment efforts. Implications for these findings allow for more targeted recruitment efforts of difficult to recruit populations, and less utilization of resources for doing so.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","100338","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use two separate surveys of Utah adults to explore the association between sociodemographic characteristics and participation in recreational activities on water quality perceptions and concerns. We find that engaging in outdoor recreation is systematically associated with more positive water quality perceptions and higher levels of concern about impaired water quality. However, water quality perceptions appear to be shaped more by social characteristics (age, education, gender, race, religion, and income) and by generic measures of overall recreation behavior than by indicators of participation in particular forms of outdoor recreational activity. There is modest evidence that hikers, birdwatchers, and anglers are generally more likely to express concerns about impaired water quality, while boaters have more positive perceptions and lower levels of concern. Management implications •The baseline results of this study can be used by water managers in Utah to track shifts in public attitudes toward water quality as the state grapples with rapid climatic and demographic changes in the coming years.•Certain types of water recreation (e.g. hiking and birdwatching) are consistently predictive of greater concern about poor water quality. More frequent participation in these types of recreation may lead to increased receptivity to public policies aimed at addressing water quality problems.•Some demographic groups in our sample are more likely to engage in outdoor recreation, which may have important implications for public engagement.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:26","2019-02-27 20:57:26","","26 - 36","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Generalized linear models; Outdoor recreation; Study replication; Survey research; Water quality concerns; Water quality perceptions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, the interaction between the port and the city regards not only the economy and transport, but also the environmental, managerial and social fields. Thus, it is essential to identify and design the most appropriate course of action in order to boost the interrelationship between these two entities, along with an efficient performance of port operations: this is possible by adopting a well-structured evaluation methodology that permits to consider many features of the issue at hand and the perspective of various stakeholders. This paper introduces an integrated evaluation method, which combines an analysis by indicators and a multi-stakeholder multi-criteria decision analysis. The method was applied to evaluate the possible implementation of two activities aiming at promoting the port-city integration through the enhancement of freight management in the Port of Trieste. The explicit engagement of the most significant stakeholders in the appraisal procedure and the understanding of their influence over the main goal of the evaluation are specific features of the method.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:32","2019-02-27 20:57:32","","119 - 126","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AHP; evaluation; Freight transport; Indicators; multi-stakeholder assessment; policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the aim to add to insights on teaching and learning, we specifically explored interpersonal adaptation in daily interactions. Adaptation, i.e., how people respond to each other's actions and reactions, is a defining characteristic of interactions. We studied 35 classrooms in secondary education. Although the degree and nature of interpersonal adaptation was in general consistent with interpersonal theory, degree of adaptation varied considerably between classrooms. In classrooms with a more preferred teacher-student relationship, behaviour of teachers and the adaptation to the behaviour of their students was more in accordance with professional standards, compared to classrooms with a less preferred relationship.

Analyses were conducted for all meals and included 9911 meal occasions. Most meals (80.5%) were consumed at home with family. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the effects of the home-family dyad on the child's chance of consuming a certain food while controlling for age, gender and BMI of the child, education, nationality and BMI of the parent. Compared to eating in other dyads (e.g. school-peers or restaurant-family), eating in the home-family dyad was associated with higher consumption of vegetables (+66% and +142% at weekday lunch and dinner and +180% and +67% at weekend lunch and dinner), lower consumption of sweets (−45% and −49% at weekday lunch and dinner; −43% and −49% at weekend lunch and dinner), and fewer soft drinks (−37% and −61% at weekday lunch and dinner; −66% and −78% at weekend lunch and dinner). This study shows the positive influence of eating at home with the family on food consumption in a sample of Swiss children. Interventions and policies that encourage children and parents to eat together at home could serve as effective prevention against a poor diet.","2018","2019-02-27 20:56:56","2019-02-27 20:56:56","","111 - 118","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet little work to-date has articulated the importance of developing a theory of change upon which to base evaluation of both implementation and outcomes. This paper undertakes an interpretive approach to develop a retrospective theory of change for an implementation evaluation of British Columbia’s school food and beverage sales Guidelines. This study contributes broadly to a nuanced conceptualization of this type of public health intervention and provides a methodological contribution on how to develop a retrospective theory of change with implications for effective evaluation. Data collection strategies included document analysis, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, and participant observation. Developing the logic model revealed that, despite the broad population health aims of the intervention, the main focus of implementation is to change behaviors of adults who create school food environments. Derived from the analysis and interpretation of the data, the emergent program theory focuses on the assumption that if adults are responsibilized through information and education campaigns and provided implementation tools, they will be ‘convinced’ to implement changes to school food environments to foster broader public health goals. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individual-level implementation indicators as well as the more often evaluated measures of food and beverage availability.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:12","2019-02-27 20:57:12","","73 - 82","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","behavior change; intervention; Logic model; Program theory; Responsibilization; School food and beverage environment; Theory of change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scratch-induced damage is a primary limitation in the suitability of brittle glasses for this purpose. However, neither truly quantitative data nor a topo-chemical understanding of the underlying deformation process which would allow for the development of improved materials is presently available. Here, we present lateral nano-indentation experiments for determining the work of deformation which is involved in the process of glass scratching. Using a series of hot-compressed vitreous silica with mild degrees of structural densification, we derive relations between quantitative scratch hardness and the underlying glass structure. We show that Young's modulus provides a clear rational for the observed variations in scratching hardness. In the specific case of silica, the energy needed to generate a certain scratch volume corresponds to roughly one tenth of Young's modulus. This relationship formally indicates that only about one tenth of the bonds which are involved in the deformation process are broken in its course. However, comparison with a more complex glass material with a certain fraction of two dimensional structural units and a strong ability for topological adaption to local stress clearly indicates a deviation from this behavior. This opens a pathway to topo-chemical engineering of scratch-resistant glasses.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:45","2019-02-27 20:57:45","","503 - 511","","","481","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Glass; Scratch hardness; Scratch resistance; Silica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore like traditional learning, this teaching approach needs continuous evaluation in order to validate its effectiveness and impact. Kirkpatrick’s model has been widely used for this purpose by health information management instructors. Our aim was to assess an E-learning Course on Breast Imaging for radiographers based on the first three levels of Kirkpatrick’s framework: reaction, learning and behaviour. Methods and materials An E-learning course was developed for radiographers in order to provide an easy-to-understand, succinct and current overview in breast imaging, namely mammography technique and image interpretation. The program structure were built based on the guidelines proposed by the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA). Learner’s satisfaction was assessed through a questionnaire and Knowledge gain was assessed using pre- and post-testing. After 6 months of complying the course, the learners were contacted through a questionnaire in order to give feedback on whether their behaviour changed in workplace. Results Two editions of the breast imaging course were performed by 64 learners. In general, 97% of the learners stated that the program content was very good and excellent, all learners considered the content was delivered in a very good or excellent way. High percentages of learners stated to be satisfied with the distribution of the content among each module (94%) and 86% of learners stated that your level of dedication was high or very high. Concerning improvement of knowledge, we found an evolution of 4 percentual points between pre and post-tests (p = 0,001). The learners have identified two main changes on their practice, the first one related with patient care, improving communications and positioning skills and the second one related with image interpretation, improving the image processing and analyses. Conclusion These global results show that e-learning can provide statistically relevant knowledge gains in Radiographers. This course is an important contribution to the improvement of mammography education, impacting on the development of students' and radiographers’ skills.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","47 - 55","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Breast imaging; Breast neoplasm; Continuing education; distance learning; Kirkpatrick framework; mammography; Teaching and assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were given the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, Spanish version for medical students, validated and adapted in Colombia. A bifactorial variance analysis (model III) was used to find the mean differences between courses and genders, and the interaction between these two factors. Data was described using simple arithmetic graphs and processed with SPSS 20.0 to estimate the total potential for growth. Results Differences were found between academic years and gender in empathy in general and in the component of “compassionate care”.

Eleven qualitative UK-based studies examining children's, parents' and providers' perspectives and experiences of programmes were synthesised to identify components felt to be critical. Studies for this views synthesis were identified from existing reviews and an update of one review's search, which was run in December 2015. The identified components were then explored in a synthesis of intervention evaluations (five ‘most effective’ and 15 ‘least effective’) conducted in western Europe, North America, Australia or New Zealand. The intervention evaluations were identified from existing reviews and an update of one review's search, which was run in March 2016. This evaluation synthesis was carried out using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Three important mechanisms were present in all the most effective interventions but absent in all the least effective: 1/ showing families how to change: a) providing child physical activity sessions, b) delivering practical behaviour change strategy sessions, c) providing calorie intake advice; 2/ ensuring all the family are on board: a) delivering discussion/education sessions for both children and parents, b) delivering child-friendly sessions, c) aiming to change behaviours across the whole family; 3/ enabling social support for both parents and children by delivering both child group sessions and parent group sessions. To conclude, programmes should ensure the whole family is on board the programme, that parents and children can receive social support and are not just told what to change, but shown how.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:12","2019-02-27 20:57:12","","1 - 12","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Child; Review; Weight reduction programs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the dimensionality check of a PA self-efficacy scale has rarely been conducted in China. The current study aims to examine (1) the unidimensionality of a shortened Chinese version of PA self-efficacy scale (S-PASESC); (2) the measurement invariance of S-PASESC across gender and levels of education; (3) the latent factor mean difference between gender and levels of education; (4) the direct effects of self-efficacy on PA by different gender and education levels; and (5) the comparisons of the direct effects of self-efficacy on PA across gender and education levels. Methods The participants were 5th through 11th grade public school students recruited from 7 cities located in different geographic regions of China. The final data include a total of 3003 participants (49.7% boys) who have completed the scales. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) test supported the unidimensionality of S-PASESC. The S-PASESC is invariant across gender and 3 levels of education at both configural, full metric, and full scalar levels. Findings from latent mean comparisons showed that boys reported higher PA self-efficacy than girls. Students' perceived PA self-efficacy tend to decrease from elementary to high school. Finally, self-efficacy positively related to PA by groups of different gender and education levels and the relationship between self-efficacy and PA is stronger among middle school boys than girls. Conclusion Findings suggest S-PASESC is a valid scale for measuring Chinese students' PA self-efficacy.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","46 - 54","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chinese adolescents; Education levels; Factor analysis; gender; Latent mean comparison; Measurement invariance; Physical activity self-efficacy scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While early adolescence constitutes a critical window of development, there is limited understanding about how adolescents perceive gender relations across different cultural settings. This study used a mixed-method approach, grounded in the voices of young people around the world, to construct and test a cross-cultural scale assessing the perceptions of gender norms regulating romantic relationships between boys and girls in early adolescence. Methods The study draws on the Global Early Adolescent study (GEAS), a study focusing on gender norms and health related outcomes over the course of adolescence in urban poor settings worldwide. In-depth interviews were first conducted among approximately 200 adolescents between 10–14 years in seven sites across 4 continents to identify common scripts guiding romantic relations in early adolescence. These scripts were then transformed into a multidimensional scale. The scale was tested among 120 adolescents in each of 14 GEAS sites, followed by a second pilot among 75 adolescents in six sites. We evaluated the psychometric criteria of each sub-scale using principal component analysis, and parallel analysis, followed by exploratory factor analysis to guide the selection of a more parsimonious set of items. Results Results suggested a two-factor structure, consisting of an “adolescent romantic expectations” subscale and a “Sexual Double Standard” subscale. Both subscales yielded high internal validity in each site, with polychoric Cronbach alpha values above 0.70 with the exception of Kinshasa for the adolescent romantic expectations scale (0.64) and Hanoi for the sexual double standard scale (0.61). Conclusion This study reveals common perceptions of gendered norms about romantic engagement in early adolescence, normative for both sexes, but socially valued for boys while devaluated for girls. The findings illustrate that social hierarchies of power in romantic relationships form early in adolescence, regardless of cultural setting.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","100314","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescence; Cross cultural research; Gender norms; measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Training outcomes were assessed pre-training, post-training and following a subsequent clinical placement. The Motivational Interviewing Knowledge and Attitudes Test (MIKAT) and an 8-item survey assessed knowledge, attitudes and confidence respectively. MI fidelity was evaluated by a simulated patient interview rated with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity scale (MITI). Analysis was by one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results Self-report measurements indicated increased confidence but no effect on knowledge or attitude. MITI analysis showed superior performance in all four global criteria and an increased frequency of MI adherent behaviours post-training. Positive changes were maintained following clinical placement. MITI summary scores indicated an improvement in question to reflection ratio in line with beginner competency. Conclusion(s) Participation in a three-day MI training programme significantly improved student confidence and MI skilfulness. Practice Implications Where feasible, MI training should be embedded within the curriculum. Further research is needed elucidate the best practices to incorporate teaching this skill set within the curriculum in order to best prepare students to counsel clients in behaviour change in their applied settings.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:33","2019-02-27 20:57:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","communication; Education; Motivational Interviewing; students; Treatment fidelity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One general explanation for this is that the effects of neural noise can be reduced, at a cost. If this were possible, reward would promote investment in resisting noise. But how could the effects of noise be attenuated, and why should this be costly? Negative feedback may be employed to compensate for disturbances in a neural representation. Such feedback would increase the robustness of neural representations to internal signal fluctuations, producing a stable attractor. We propose that encoding this negative feedback in neural signals would incur additional costs proportional to the strength of the feedback signal. We use eye movements to test the hypothesis that motivation by reward improves precision by increasing the strength of internal negative feedback. We find that reward simultaneously increases the amplitude, velocity and endpoint precision of saccades, indicating true improvement in oculomotor performance. Analysis of trajectories demonstrates that variation in the eye position during the course of saccades is predictive of the variation of endpoints, but this relation is reduced by reward. This indicates that motivation permits more aggressive correction of errors during the saccade, so that they no longer affect the endpoint. We suggest that such increases in internal negative feedback allow attractor stability, albeit at a cost, and therefore may explain how motivation improves cognitive as well as motor precision.","2019","2019-02-27 20:58:02","2019-02-27 20:58:02","","19 - 29","","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive effort; eye movements; motivation; Noise; Oculomotor; Optimal control theory; Reward; Saccades","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has identified three contributing factors to road crashes, namely child behaviour, driver behaviour, and the environment. This study aims to identify critical beliefs that influence motorcyclist's intention to comply with the Malaysian school zone speed limit (SZSL). 159 Malaysian motorcyclists who have travel experience in school zones during school hours and non-school hours were recruited by using purposive sampling. Participants responded to a survey distributed by enumerators in public places and house-to-house survey conducted in Kedah, Malaysia. Step-by-step correlation and regression analysis were used to identify the motorcyclists' critical beliefs. The results identified that motorcyclists' beliefs of the community expectation for them to comply and that complying with the speed limit in school zones may reduce risk of crashes with school children were the critical beliefs. In addition, the observation of many motorcyclists in the school zone was also identified as critical beliefs influencing motorcyclists' intention to comply with the SZSL. The practical relevance of this study is to combine a public awareness campaign and safety education for the motorcyclists together with an enforcement method to reinforce motorcyclists' compliance with the SZSL. Additionally, to increase the awareness level among motorcyclists, traffic control devices, such as flashing lights and yellow lines could be implemented.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:12","2019-02-27 20:57:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Child safety; Intention; Motorcyclist; road safety; School zone; Theory of Planned Behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Institute is composed of 7 cores designed to improve treatment options and outcomes for patients with glomerular disease: Clinical Trials Network, Data Warehouse, Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) and Endpoints Consortium, Clinical Trials Consulting Team, Quality Initiatives, Education and Engagement, and Data Coordinating Center. Methods The Trials Network includes 22 community- and hospital-based nephrology practices, 14 of which are trial-only sites. Eight sites participate in the NACI Registry, and as of October 2017, 1054 patients are enrolled with diagnoses including but not limited to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, and childhood-onset nephrotic syndrome. By using electronic health record data extraction, robust and efficient clinical data are captured while minimizing the burden to site-based network staff. Results The Data Warehouse includes her-extracted data from registry patients, PRO development data, and data from completed observational studies and clinical trials. The Clinical Trial Consulting Team provides support for trial design in rare diseases leveraging these data. The PRO and Endpoints Consortium develops shorter-term endpoints while capturing the patient-reported significance of interventions under study. The Quality Initiatives and Education/Engagement cores elevate the level of care for patients. The Data Coordinating Center manages the analysis and operations of the Institute. Conclusion By engaging with patients, academia, industry, and patient advocate community representatives, including our Patient Advisory Board, NACI strives for better outcomes and treatments using evidence-based support for clinical trial design.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:48","2019-02-27 20:57:48","","439 - 446","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","clinical trials; electronic health record; glomerular disease; nephrotic syndrome; patient advisory; patient-reported outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing upon research on the science of team science, this study investigated the way that interactions around research emerged over the course of establishing a new research center. The objectives were to document changes in research activity and describe how human research support infrastructure functioned to support the production of science. Methods Social network analyses were used to model coauthorship relationships based on publication histories from baseline (2014) through the current grant year (2017) for key personnel (n = 12), as well as survey data on collaborative engagement among CNTN members (n = 59). Results Exponential random graph models indicated that over time, CNTN members were increasingly likely to form coauthorship relationships. Community detection algorithms and brokerage analyses suggested that the CNTN was functioning as intended to support scientific development.

However, underlying neural mechanisms of WM deficits are not well understood to date, and empirical evidence for a proposed conceptual link to inhibition deficits is missing. We investigated WM performance in a numeric n-back task with four WM load conditions during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in 51 patients with OCD and 49 healthy control participants who were matched for age, sex, and education. Additionally, a stop signal task was performed outside the MRI scanner in a subsample. On the behavioral level, a significant WM load by group interaction was found for both accuracy (p<0.02) and reaction time measures (p<0.03), indicating increased reaction times as well as reduced accuracy specifically at high WM load (3-back) in patients with OCD. Whole-brain analyses of fMRI-data identified neural correlates of a load-dependent WM decrement in OCD in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Within the OCD sample, SMA-activity as well as n-back performance were correlated with stop signal task performance. Results from behavioral and fMRI-analyses indicate a reduced WM load-dependent modulation of neural activity in OCD and suggest a common neural mechanism for inhibitory dysfunction and WM decrements in OCD.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:57","2019-02-27 20:57:57","","426 - 434","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fMRI; Inhibition; Neuroimaging; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Stop signal task; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

University-industry partnerships should be sustained for inspiring up-to-date RTD, and industry-driven antecedences should be reinforced. The positioning by these authors had a solid accent on university-industry partnerships over the entire course of the ASCENT project to increase societal resilience to disasters. Collaboration appointments can appear in numerous forms and dimensions (career fairs, business advisors and affiliates, placements, conferences and meetings, project and university initiative support, program improvement, scholar fellowships, joint life cycle collaboration, RTD projects and product/service development). The forms and stages of partnership will fluctuate depending on the micro-, meso- and macro-levels of the environment. A founder of behavioral economics, Nobel Prize laureate Daniel Kahneman, asserts that two categories describe our thinking: fast thinking (first system) and slow thinking (second system). The foundation of the first system consists of emotions, impulses and exaggerated optimism. The first system does not require any great efforts; it operates practically automatically. Meanwhile the second thinking system is slow and analytical with an ability to control behavior and thoughts.

Guidelines support these claims. Objectives To investigate whether an informed shared decision-making intervention for women with ‘ductal carcinoma in situ’ comprising an evidence-based decision aid with nurse-led decision coaching enhances the extent of the mutual shared decision-making behavior of patients and professionals regarding treatment options, and to analyze implementation barriers. Design Cluster randomized controlled trial with accompanying process evaluation. Setting Certified breast care centers in Germany. Participants Women with ductal carcinoma in situ and no previous history of breast cancer facing a primary treatment decision. Methods Sixteen breast centers were randomized to intervention or standard care to recruit 192 patients (partially-blinded). All coaching sessions and physician consultations were videotaped to assess the primary outcome ‘extent of patient involvement in shared decision-making’ using the MAPPIN-Odyad observer instrument (scores 0 to 4). Secondary endpoints included the sub-measures of the MAPPIN-inventory (MAPPIN-Onurse, MAPPIN-Ophysician, MAPPIN-Opatient, MAPPIN-Qnurse, MAPPIN-Qpatient and MAPPIN-Qphysician), ‘informed choice’, ‘decisional conflict’ and ‘duration of consultations’. Primary intention-to-treat analyses were on cluster level comparing means of cluster values using t-tests. An accompanying process evaluation was conducted comprising 1) analysis of all video recordings with focus on procedures and intervention fidelity and 2) field notes of researchers and feedback from professionals and patients assessed by questionnaires and interviews with focus on barriers and facilitators for implementation at different time points. Results Due to protracted recruitment, the study was terminated after 14 centers had included 64 patients (intervention group 36, control group 28). Patient participation in informed shared decision-making was significantly higher in the intervention group (mean (SD) score 2.29 (0.56) vs. 0.42 (0.51) in the control group; difference 1.88 (95% CI 1.26–2.50, p < 0.0001). 47.7% women in the intervention group made informed choices, but none in the control group, difference 47.7% (95% CI 12.6-82.7%, p = 0.016). In the intervention group physician consultations lasted 12.8 (6.6) min. vs. 24.3 (6.3) min. in the control group. Physicians’ attitudes, false incentives and structural barriers hindered implementation of informed shared decision-making. Nurses appreciated their new roles. Conclusions Informed shared decision-making is not yet implemented in German breast care centers. Nurse-led decision coaching grounded on evidence-based patient information enhances informed shared decision-making.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:59","2019-02-27 20:57:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","breast neoplasms; carcinoma; cluster randomized trial; Decision making; evidence-based medicine; intraductal; noninfiltrating; oncology nursing; patient education as topic; patient participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In implementing any learning system such as mobile learning, users’ expectations should be taken into consideration. However, there is a lack of studies on this aspect, particularly in the context of Kuwait higher education (HE) institutions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate students’ and instructors’ perceptions toward the use of mobile devices in learning, and to understand the challenges that affect its implementation. Although m-learning is used in the developed countries and considered as an effective educational tool, it is not yet fully utilized in Kuwait, as a developing country. This study reports on the results of a survey conducted on 623 students, and 132 instructors from HE institutions in Kuwait, in order to understand their perceptions and opinions about the effectiveness of the use of mobile learning. An analysis of the quantitative survey findings is presented in this article, and the findings indicated that students and instructors are very familiar with mobile devices and its applications. The results also revealed that students and instructors have positive perceptions of m-learning, and indicated that video-based social media applications are widely used among them. However, the study reports some social and cultural issues that may act as barriers to m-learning implementation.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:48","2019-02-27 20:57:48","","279 - 289","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","e-learning; Higher Education; Implementation challenges; m-learning; Perceptions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The growing ubiquity of Web access, and the variety of devices that allow us to interact with it, have made it possible for learners to choose the tools and services that better adapt to their needs, providing a means of personalizing the learning experience. In this paper, we report the results of research on learner-created Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) based on Web 2.0 services, in the context of higher education, as both a means of transforming learning and teaching processes, and as preparation for the learners’ future professional lives in a dynamic environment with a heavy digital and technological influence. The methodology used was Design-Based Research, by carrying out an intervention in practice settings in a subject at higher education level; this intervention and its successive iterations allowed for a continuous process of data collection and analysis, which was in turn used to modify and create new interventions. The original pilot test and successive iterations ran from 2009 to 2012, with a second round of data collection carried out between 2014 and 2016. The analysis of the data provided evidence of PLEs as tools for learning and acquiring skills, strengthening social interactions, and improvement in the organization and management of content and learning resources; it also helped identify obstacles and barriers, and possible solutions. The main outcome of this research is presented as a set of guidelines for using PLEs as tools for supporting formal learning, either by teachers or by the learners themselves.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:34","2019-02-27 20:57:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital transformation; Higher Education; learning technologies; Personal Learning Environments (PLE); ℡; web 2.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant differences were observed between the farmers’ regarding information of pesticides (χ2 = 19.679 at p < 0.05). 35% farmers of SU reported different mass communication devices as a primary source of information while 36% farmers from MU reported other farmers as their sources of information followed by pesticide dealers (28%). Proper storage and uses of personal protective equipment (PPE) were absent. However, significant differences were also observed to cover face with cloth (χ2 = 22.019 at p < 0.05). Farmers of SU used partial cover 69% while in MU 48% farmers reported no covering. Only 14% and 5% of farmers reported the full use of PPE in both areas. 39% farmers and 42% farmers of the SU and MU, respectively, reported throwing empty pots into the nearby water body followed by taking home for reuse by 31% and 24%, respectively. 88% farmers of SU vs. 82% farmers of MU consumed betel leaf, tobacco or smoking during spraying. 87% in SU and 66% in MU believed that pesticide application decreased soil fertility (χ2 = 12.265 at p < 0.05). About 83% farmers in SU and 24% farmers in MU reported that surface water pollution occurred due to pesticide χ2 = 69.963 at p < 0.05); excessive uses of pesticides destroyed beneficial insects (χ2 = 73.509 at p < 0.05). 67% farmers of SU and 26% farmers of MU responded that environmental quality was deteriorating.

By 2015, all Global Plan priority countries, except Nigeria, had adopted the Option B+ programme.Nigeria finally adopted Option B+ in 2016 with full implementation reported in 2017. We examined adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women since the rollout of Option B+ in Nigeria. Methods A cross sectional approach was adopted that involved dissemination of a survey (Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Groups [AACTG] standardised survey) to HIV positive pregnant women, to assess adherence to ART. This study was conducted from February to June, 2018 in four health care sites in Akwa Ibom State, in the South-South region of Nigeria. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of adherence. Bivariate associations between patient demographic characteristics and medication taking behaviours, and the outcome variable of ART adherence were examined using Chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with adherence. Results Of the 275 women (response rate=92.6%), 32.7% (95% CI: 26.9 to 38.5) self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 96hours. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, there were positive associations between an increased education level (OR=1.7, p=0.006) and disclosure of HIV status (OR=2.3, p=0.024), and medication adherence. For women who had previous prevention of MTCT exposure, the odds of medication adherence were 2.5 times higher compared with those with no previous MTCT exposure (OR=2.5, p=0.005). Conclusion Adherence to ART among pregnant women in Nigeria is low.

Group working is an element of pedagogy which draws on the social aspects of learning to facilitate knowledge and skills development, but its potential role in facilitating professional identity formation has as yet been under researched. Objectives This study aimed to explore the potential of mutual learning through group work to contribute not only to academic knowledge and understanding, but also to the development of students' professional values and selves. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 home and international first year undergraduate pharmacy students in a UK School of Pharmacy, to explore their experiences of interacting for learning with other students on the course. Findings Thematic analysis of the interview data highlighted four main benefits of mutual learning, which are that it: promotes friendly interactions; aids learning about the subject and the profession; opens the mind through different opinions and ways of thinking; and enables learning about other people. Through working together students developed their communication skills and confidence; reflectively considered their own stance in the light of others' experiences and healthcare perspectives; and started to gain a wider worldview, potentially informing their future interactions with patients and colleagues. Some difficulties arose when group interactions functioned less well. Conclusions Opportunity for collaboration and exchange can positively influence development of students' professional outlook and values. However, careful management of group working is required, in order to create a mutually supportive environment wherein students feel able to interact, share and develop together.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:04","2019-02-27 20:57:04","","290 - 294","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","group work; Internationalisation; Pharmacy student; Professional identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to define psychosocial and lifestyle outcomes for young adults on RRT compared to the general population. Study Design We undertook a cross-sectional survey (the SPEAK [Surveying Patients Experiencing Young Adult Kidney Failure] Study) using validated measures and general population comparator data from the Health Survey for England and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Additional clinical information was obtained from the UK Renal Registry. Setting & Participants 16- to 30-year-olds receiving RRT. Outcomes Psychosocial health and lifestyle behaviors. Analytical Approach We compared outcomes between populations using age- and sex-adjusted regression models, weighted to account for response bias by sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Our findings were used to update recent meta-analyses. Results We recruited 976 young adults and 64% responded to the survey: 417 (71%) with kidney transplants and 173 (29%) on dialysis therapy. Compared to the general population, young adults on RRT were less likely to be in a relationship and have children and more likely to live in the family home, receive no income, and be unable to work due to health. They had poorer quality of life, worse well-being, and twice the likelihood of a psychological disturbance (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0-3.7; P<0.001). They reported less smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, and crime. In a meta-analysis, our study showed the greatest differences in quality of life compared to the general population. Limitations Cross-sectional study design, meaning that we could not track the impact of treatment changes on the outcomes. Conclusions This study involving a large cohort of young adult transplant recipients and dialysis patients provides evidence of worse psychosocial outcomes but more positive lifestyle behaviors in young adults on RRT compared to the age-matched general population.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:44","2019-02-27 20:57:44","","194 - 205","","2","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","adolescent; chronic disease; dialysis; disease burden; Education; employment; end-stage renal disease (ESRD); kidney failure; Kidney transplantation; lifestyle; lifestyle disruption; mental health; quality of life (QOL); relationships; renal replacement therapy (RRT); survey; young adult; youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we explored the relationship between temporal hemodynamic changes and language performance in chronic post-stroke aphasia. We collected detailed language and neuropsychological data for 66 patients with chronic (>1 year) post-stroke aphasia. We used principal component analysis to extract their core language-neuropsychological features. From resting-state fMRI scans in 35 patients, we calculated the lag in the time-course of the intact brain voxels in each patient. Finally, variation across the language-cognitive factors was related to both the patients' structural damage and the time-course changes in each patient's intact tissue. Phonological abilities were correlated with the structural integrity of the left superior temporal, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and arcuate fasciculus regions and hemodynamic advance in the left intra-parietal sulcus. Speech fluency related to integrity of premotor regions, plus hemodynamic advance in the left middle/superior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and right angular gyrus. Semantic performance reflected a combination of medial ventral temporal lobe status and hemodynamic delay in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Finally, executive abilities correlated with hemodynamic delay in the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, right rolandic operculum, bilateral supplementary motor areas/middle cingulum areas, and bilateral thalamus/caudate. Following stroke, patients' patterns of chronic language abilities reflects a combination of structural and functional integrity across a distributed network of brain regions. The correlation between hemodynamic changes and behaviours may have clinical importance.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","611 - 619","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hemodynamic changes; Lesion; Resting-state fMRI; Stroke aphasia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reverse engineering is a fast and innovative method of converting a physical model into a virtual one based on its physical and mechanical characteristics. The paper aims to develop the geometric and numerical virtual model of the behavior of a lignocellulosic material subjected to cyclical stresses (tensile-compression) based on mechanical characteristics determined through experimental tests. The importance of this study consists of identifying the simulation method by comparing the experimental results with the numerical results (engineering objective) and developing the working methodology with effect in the education for sustainable development. Modeling with the finite element method (FEM) based on the physical model aimed to determine the results spectrum which are interpolating with the experimentally ones. Thus, the CAD model of the real sample was made by attributing its physical and elastic characteristics using the HyperMesh (preprocessing) and HyperWorks software (post-processing). The model was meshed into QUAD4 elements, after which it were simulated the cyclical stresses on tensile-compression in successive stages, keeping in memory of each stage the changes made at the structural level in the previous stage. Finally, the theoretical results were compared with the experimental ones. The obtained results provide information about distribution of stresses and strains on each layer of material according to the type of stress, traction or compression, for each loading cycle. The values obtained with FEA are close to the experimental ones. The minor differences are due to using an approximate decrease of the modulus of elasticity after each stress cycle. To obtained the real values of Young’s Modulus after each cycle would have been necessary a big consumption of samples. The reverse engineering method has the advantage of material economy and the ability to carry out a large number of numerical models to replicate the material’s behavior more accurately to cyclical loading and even improve its properties by designing a new material.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:48","2019-02-27 20:57:48","","65 - 72","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cyclic loading; finite element analyses (FEA); lignocellulosic materials; Reverse engineering (RE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agriculture is one of the human work activities with the highest risk indexes. Studies on risk perception of agricultural workers are often referred to as specific risk factors (especially pesticides), but the risk perception plays an important role in preventing every kind of accident and occupational disease. Methods The aim of this research is to test a new method for understanding the relation between risk perception among farmers and the main risk factors to which they are exposed. A secondary aim is to investigate the influence of training in risk perception in agriculture. The data collection was realized using a questionnaire designed to investigate the risk perception; the questionnaire was given to a sample of 119 agricultural workers in central Italy. Through the use of the “principal components analysis” it was possible to highlight and verify the latent dimensions underlying the collected data in comparison with scales of attitudes. Results Results show that the highest percentage of strong negative attitude is among the people who have worked for more years, while farmers who have worked for fewer years have a marked positive attitude. Conclusion The analysis of the questionnaires through the synthetic index method (Rizzi index) showed that agricultural workers involved, in particular the elderly workers, have a negative attitude towards safety; workers are hostile to safety measures if they have not attended special training courses.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:34","2019-02-27 20:57:34","","164 - 171","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","agriculture; PCA; risk perception; Rizzi index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined e-cigarette susceptibility and ever use prevalence among central Texas middle school students by the level of economic disadvantage (ED) of their school. As a secondary aim, we explored gender and ethnic differences (Hispanic vs. White) in e-cigarette susceptibility across school ED levels. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of baseline data collected in 2017 as part of the CATCH My Breath study. Participants (n = 5278) were 6th grade students from 23 central Texas public middle schools. E-cigarette susceptibility/use and demographics were self-reported; school ED was determined by Texas Education Agency. Analyses included chi-square tests and multi-level logistic regression. E-cigarette susceptibility and use varied by school ED for total sample (p < .0001) and by ethnicity (p ≤ .003). While e-cigarette susceptibility was higher in boys (p < .001), no gender differences were found for e-cigarette use. Students in the highest school ED quartile (Q4) (lowest SES) had significantly higher odds of e-cigarette susceptibility (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.49–2.71) and use (AOR = 8.12, 95% CI: 2.58–26.30) compared with Q1 students. Significant gender differences in e-cigarette susceptibility persisted within school ED quartiles 1–3 (p ≤ .001); no gender differences were found for Q4 (p = .537). Despite overall higher e-cigarette susceptibility for Hispanic students, they had similar prevalence as White students within three school ED quartiles. Findings underscore a higher risk for e-cigarette susceptibility/use among central Texas sixth graders attending high ED schools and provide foundation for further exploration of the school socioeconomic context in adolescent e-cigarette use.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","105 - 108","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescence; Context; E-cigarettes; gender; Hispanic; Schools; Settings; Socioeconomic; Tobacco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All NHS employees are recruited on the basis of a prescribed set of values. This is extended to the recruitment of student healthcare professionals, yet there is little research of how to implement this. Involving Service Users in healthcare educational practice is gaining momentum internationally, yet involvement of service users in VBR of ‘would be’ healthcare professionals remains at an embryonic phase. Adult nurses represent the largest healthcare workforce in the UK, yet involvement of service users in their recruitment has received scant attention. This paper is an evaluation of the inclusion of service users in a VBR of 640 adult student nurses. Background Design This study used a participatory mixed methods approach, with service users as co-researchers in the study. Methods The study consisted of mixed methods design. Quantitative data via an online questionnaire to ascertain candidates' perspectives (n=269 response rate of 42%), and academic/clinical nurses (n=35 response rate 34.65%). Qualitative data were gathered using focus groups and one to one interviews with service users (n=9). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Findings 4 overarching themes were identified; increasing sense of humanness, substantiating care values; impact of involvement; working together and making it work, a work in progress. Conclusion The findings from the study highlight that involving service users in VBR of student healthcare professionals has benefits to candidates, service users and local health services. Appreciating the perceptions of healthcare professionals is fundamental in the UK and internationally to implementing service users' engagement in service enhancement and delivery. Findings from this study identify there may be a dissonance between the policy, the nurses' thoughts and their practice.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:14","2019-02-27 20:57:14","","107 - 113","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nurse recruitment; Nursing; Service users; Student nurse; Values; Values based recruitment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to examine poor social connectedness as a possible barrier to participation in preventive health services among older people (aged 53–69 years). Methods We analysed data from a prospective cohort study of 5362 socially stratified births from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development enrolled in England, Scotland, and Wales in March 1946. At ages 68–69 years, participants reported participation in blood pressure and cholesterol measurement, eyesight and dental check-ups, influenza immunisation, and bowel and breast cancer screening. Our primary outcome measure summed participation across all these tests and services at ages 68–69 years. We tested associations between structural and functional social connectedness from ages 53 years to 69 years and total count of participation in these preventive services in Poisson models controlling for sex, education, occupational class, employment, chronic illnesses, and general practitioner consultations for health problems. Findings 940 (44%) of 2132 participants attended all preventive services within the recommended timeframes. At ages 68–69 years, being unmarried or not cohabiting (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1·33, 95% CI 1·20–1·47) and small personal social networks (IRR 1·51, 1·32–1·71) were independently associated with non-participation in more services, with associations consistent across most services. High social relationship quality at ages 68–69 years (IRR 0·91, 95% CI 0·87–0·95) and increasing social relationship quality from ages 53 years to 69 years (IRR 0·93, 0·89–0·97) were associated with low risk of non-participation. Interpretation Individuals with poor social connectedness appear to be at greater risk of not engaging in the full range of preventive services than individuals with good social connectedness. Improvement of access to social contacts and networks in older ages is already recommended for the maintenance of good mental health. This study suggests that social connectedness could also improve participation in a wide range of preventive health services, and hence could improve use of the health-care system and population health.

Objective To study and visualize socioeconomic gradient in soda and salad consumption using a geo-localized measure of socioeconomic status in contrast to more traditional measures. Methods Geo-localized dietary intake data came from the Seattle Obesity Study I, a population-based sample of King County adults (n=1099). Socio-demographic data and soda and salad consumption frequencies (times/week) were obtained by 20-min telephone survey. Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data were used to construct Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores. Individual residential property values obtained from the King County tax assessor. Multivariable linear regressions examined socioeconomic gradient in the frequency of soda and salad consumption by residential property values, the primary independent variable, in comparison to annual household incomes and educational attainment, with adjustment for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Geographic disparities in soda and salad consumption by property value metric were illustrated at the census block level using modeled predicted marginal means. Results Among all three socioeconomic indicators (income, education and residential property values), residential property values captured strongest gradient in soda and salad consumption. Higher quintiles of residential property values were associated with lower soda and higher salad consumption. Respondents living in the highest quintile of property values −1.04 fewer sodas per week (95% CI= −1.87, −0.21) and 0.89 more salads per week (95% CI= 0.36, 1.42), adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Residential property values illustrated geographic disparities in soda and salad consumption at the census-block level. Conclusion Geo-localized disparities in food consumption patterns by neighborhood can inform current discourse on the socioeconomic determinants of health, while providing a useful tool for targeted interventions at the local level.","2019","2019-02-27 20:58:03","2019-02-27 20:58:03","","100339","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Diet; geographic information systems; Residential property values; socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the correlation between the two psychological responses and EOG parameters. We could confirm the qualitative correlation between the EOG parameter corresponding to concentration power and the psychological response. At this point, we presume that it could be applied to e-learning in virtual classrooms soon.

In practice, detecting signs of awareness may be hindered by possible impairments in the patient's motoric, sensory, or cognitive abilities, resulting in a substantial proportion of misdiagnosed disorders of consciousness. Task-free paradigms that are independent of the patient's sensorimotor and neurocognitive abilities may offer a solution to this challenge. A limitation of previous research is that the large majority of studies on the pathophysiological processes underlying disorders of consciousness have been conducted using cross-sectional designs. Here, we present a study in which we acquired a total of 74 longitudinal task-free EEG measurements from 16 patients (aged 6–22years, 12 male) suffering from severe acquired brain injury, and an additional 16 age- and education-matched control participants. We examined changes in amplitude and connectivity metrics of oscillatory brain activity within patients across their recovery. Moreover, we applied multi-class linear discriminant analysis to assess the potential diagnostic and prognostic utility of amplitude and connectivity metrics at the individual-patient level. We found that over the course of their recovery, patients exhibited nonlinear frequency band-specific changes in spectral amplitude and connectivity metrics, changes that aligned well with the metrics' frequency band-specific diagnostic value. Strikingly, connectivity during a single task-free EEG measurement predicted the level of patient recovery approximately 3months later with 75% accuracy. Our findings show that spectral amplitude and connectivity track patient recovery in a longitudinal fashion, and these metrics are robust pathophysiological markers that can be used for the automated diagnosis and prognosis of disorders of consciousness. These metrics can be acquired inexpensively at bedside, and are fully independent of the patient's neurocognitive abilities. Lastly, our findings tentatively suggest that the relative preservation of thalamo-cortico-thalamic interactions may predict the later reemergence of awareness, and could thus shed new light on the pathophysiological processes that underlie disorders of consciousness.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:59","2019-02-27 20:57:59","","43 - 52","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brain injury; classification; Disorders of consciousness; EEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamical behaviors of the model are discussed in terms of the basic reproduction number R0. By constructing Lyapunov functions, we obtain the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R0≤1 and the drug addiction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R0>1. Sensitivity analyses are performed to seek for effective control measures for drug spread. The analysis show that both the family and public health education can influence the spread of drug transmission. However, the combination of family and public health education is more effective to reduce the prevalence of drugs. Some numerical simulations are given to confirm the obtained theoretical results.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","74 - 84","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Basic reproduction number; Drug model; Public health education; Sensitivity; Stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an artificial language learning experiment, we show that there exist at least two independent sources of regularization bias in cognition: a domain-general source based on cognitive load and a domain-specific source triggered by linguistic stimuli. Both of these factors modulate how frequency information is encoded and produced, but only the production-side modulations result in regularization (i.e. cause learners to eliminate variation from the observed input). We formalize the definition of regularization as the reduction of entropy and find that entropy measures are better at identifying regularization behavior than frequency-based analyses. Using our experimental data and a model of cultural transmission, we generate predictions for the amount of regularity that would develop in each experimental condition if the artificial language were transmitted over several generations of learners. Here we find that the effect of cognitive constraints can become more complex when put into the context of cultural evolution: although learning biases certainly carry information about the course of language evolution, we should not expect a one-to-one correspondence between the micro-level processes that regularize linguistic datasets and the macro-level evolution of linguistic regularity.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:04","2019-02-27 20:57:04","","53 - 68","","","184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Domain generality; Domain specificity; Frequency learning; Language evolution; Regularisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods This study is a quasi-experiment in nonequivalent control group design. Thirty-eight heart failure patients underwent medical treatment at the hospital (18 heart failure patients in the experimental group and 20 heart failure patients in the control group). The experimental group (n = 18) received the telephone-based self-management support program, which included a 30-minute face-to-face education session and four telephone consultation and education sessions. The face-to-face education session was conducted at the first visit to the outpatient clinic. Thereafter, weekly telephone consultations and education sessions were performed for 4 weeks. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t test, paired t test, and repeated measures analysis of variance using the SPSS/WIN 21.0. Results The participants in the experimental group showed significantly increased self-care behavior scores (t = 6.65, p < .001), decreased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level (U = −2.28, p = .022), improved left ventricular ejection fraction values (t = 2.24, p = .032), and decreased depression scores (t = −3.49, p = .001) compared with the control group. Conclusion The findings indicate that the telephone-based self-management program is an effective intervention to improve self-management in heart failure patients.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:16","2019-02-27 20:57:16","","251 - 257","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","depression; heart failure; heart function tests; self care; telephone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Six hundred and twenty employees in a variety of manufacturing organizations were asked to complete to a questionnaire. Among them, a total of 376 employees provided valid data for analysis. To test the hypothesis, correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS program, version 23. Results The results indicated that workload and accident experiences have a positive influence and safety leadership and safety climate have a negative influence on the cognitive and emotional risk perception. Workload, safety leadership, and the safety climate influence perceived risk more than accident experience, especially for the emotional risk perception. Conclusion These results indicated that multilevel factors (organization, group, and individual) play a critical role in predicting individual risk perceptions. Based on these results, therefore, to reduce risk perception related with unsafe behaviors and accidents, organizations need to conduct a variety of safety programs that enhance their safety climate beyond simple safety-related education and training. Simultaneously, it needs to seek ways to promote supervisors' safety leadership behaviors (e.g., site visits, feedback, safety communication, etc.). In addition, it is necessary to adjust work speed and amount and allocate task considering employees' skill and ability to reduce the workload for reducing risk perception.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:45","2019-02-27 20:57:45","","427 - 433","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accident experience; risk perception; Safety climate; Safety leadership; workload","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many water experts believe that this crisis can be overcome by fostering sustainable environmental behavior in the utilization of groundwater resources and increasing the farmers' environmental knowledge, attitude and emotions. The objective of this study was to investigate transformation of environmental knowledge to sustainable use of groundwater resources through the analysis of the mediating role of environmental emotions in Iran's agriculture. This research was carried out via a survey technique within the category of descriptive-correlation and causal-relational research. All the wheat producing farmers of Sistan and Baluchestan Province, which is a clear example of critical conditions for groundwater resources in Iran (N=168,873), constituted the statistical population of the study of whom 384 participants were selected using a stratified random sampling method. The research instrument was a questionnaire whose validity was confirmed by a panel of professionals in agricultural extension, education and water management. The reliability of the items of the questionnaire was also evaluated via a pilot study and Cronbach's alpha (0.70≤α≤0.84). The results of the causal analysis indicated that environmental knowledge (β=0.309) and environmental emotions (β=0.565) have the significant influence on sustainable environmental behavior in the utilization of groundwater among wheat farmers. Therefore, it can be said environmental emotions is an important mediating factor for potentially improving water stakeholders' sustainable environmental behavior.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:33","2019-02-27 20:57:33","","143 - 152","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Causal analysis; Environmental emotions (EE); Environmental knowledge (EK); Groundwater; Sustainable environmental behavior (SEB)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the system change pathway is investigated through cleverly neutralizing time in the analysis. The new expression of “neutralizing time” is defined as time is not considered during the system stack-based change pathway calculations, but it will only be sensed in the sequence order. By adopting this concept, the formulations cleverly avoid falling in the trap of the long dilemma of “the problem of time” when handling the system change pathways. This is equivalent to representing the system by two-level configuration: the basic level of the physical system is considered as temporal, while the upper level of affecting events is regarded as non-temporal. Furthermore, it is shown that the infinite multi-stacking interactions at any event state of global systems could provide the necessary mathematical platform for analyzing the natural or intentionally induced “synchronicity” principle. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the successful applicability of the new time neutralized concept. The first example describes the course of life of inverted pendulum trolley car subject to accidents and collision influences. The second example elucidates the change pathway of the formation of human bladder spherical crystalline stone versus different change formulas under excessive salt/mineral concentrations influences. It is revealed that these illustrative examples could provide a positive assertive answer to the important question: “Can the presented change pathway theory through backward stacking, neutralized time effect, and satisfying the reversibility property mathematically uncover many open secrets such as the origins of matter and antimatter?”. Applications of the new concept to some real life single stacking and multi-stacking examples are also discussed. It is recommended that future work shall be directed toward strengthening the new concept for multi-stacking system change pathway platforms. Such recommendation could also be generalized for implementing the concept in retrospective or backward stacking way to various real life applications, such as for analyzing the past sequential (evolutionary) formation of matter/substances and uncovering the mysterious origins of many versatile systems.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:35","2019-02-27 20:57:35","","101 - 124","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied and natural sciences; Consolidity theory; Fractals-General Science; Stack-based system change pathways; Synchronicity principle; Temporal versus non-temporal relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C5a, a complement activation end product, is a strong inflammatory cell stimulator and can influence the behavior of T cells and dendritic cells. This study examined the etiology–disease relationship and significance of auto-antibody and C5a with short-term remission. Method Plasma anti-PLA2R antibody and C5a were measured with the blood samples that were collected when patients were admitted for renal biopsy. The deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM, C1q and C3c in glomerulus was graded according to immunofluorescence staining. The relationship of anti-PLA2R antibody with C5a, glomerular immunoglobulin and complement deposition was examined. Antibody and C5a levels as predictors of short-term remission were also examined. Results In 72 IMN patients, 50 patients had positive plasma anti-PLA2R antibody. The antibody had positive correlation to proteinuria. Patients with high grade IgG or C3c, but not IgA/IgM/C1q, deposition had higher anti-PLA2R antibody titers. C5a was increased in IMN patients, but had no correlation with anti-PLA2R antibody or proteinuria. The analysis revealed that C5a, not initial anti-PLA2R antibody, was a predictor associated with 12-month remission in patients receiving immunosuppression with multivariate-adjusted OR 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58–0.94, P = 0.01). Conclusion This study provides indirect evidences of etiology–disease relationship of anti-PLA2R antibody in IMN patients. The role of C5a, a predictor of remission, in the disease course of MN and the influences on inflammatory cells in MN patients is worth to be clarified.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:57","2019-02-27 20:57:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody; C5a; Disease activity; Membranous nephropathy; Prognosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies suggest that Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) programs that specifically target health anxiety are efficacious for this condition. However, no known studies have examined the impact of transdiagnostic ICBT, which emphasizes the acquisition of broad coping skills applicable to a variety of mental health concerns, on symptoms of health anxiety. The current study sought to explore changes in health anxiety symptoms by utilizing data available from a previously published study of 8-week transdiagnostic ICBT. Specifically, changes in symptoms of health anxiety in response to a transdiagnostic ICBT program that targeted broad symptoms of depression and anxiety, were examined in a subsample of individuals who endorsed elevated symptom scores on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory at pre-treatment (n = 72). Following treatment, large reductions in health anxiety symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.91; 20% improvement), depression (Cohen's d = 0.85; reduction = 38%), generalized anxiety (Cohen's d = 1.21; reduction = 42%), and disability (Cohen's d = 0.90; reduction = 35%) were reported. Furthermore, results showed that transdiagnostic ICBT was rated as acceptable to people with high health anxiety symptoms. Despite elevated pre-treatment health anxiety scores, email correspondence between clients and their therapist revealed very few mentions of health anxiety. These findings provide preliminary evidence for transdiagnostic ICBT for symptoms of health anxiety and suggest further research is warranted.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:33","2019-02-27 20:57:33","","60 - 66","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive behavior therapy; Health anxiety; Internet-delivered; Transdiagnostic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is of particular importance as an increasing number of technologies and business models are focusing on the end-users. These developments provide new opportunities for further technical and social innovation to smarter, flexible and integrated systems such as community energy systems (CESs). Through system integration and community engagement CESs assist in transition to a low-carbon energy system. Despite the high importance, there is limited knowledge on willingness of local citizens to participate in the local energy systems such as CESs as well as associated factors determining such willingness. Through a survey among 599 citizens in the Netherlands, this research analyses the impact of demographic, socio-economic, socio-institutional as well as environmental factors on willingness to participate in CESs. Factor and multi-variate regression analysis reveals that the environmental concern, renewables acceptance, energy independence, community trust, community resistance, education, energy related education and awareness about local energy initiatives are the most important factors in determining the citizens’ willingness to participate in CESs. Citizens should be empowered to take active role in steering the local energy initiatives.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:23","2019-02-27 20:57:23","","33 - 40","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citizen participation; Distributed energy resources; Energy communities; Energy transition; Factor analysis; Multi-variate regression analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Safety-I perspective sees violations as undesirable digressions from standardised procedures, while a Safety-II perspective sees violations as adaptations to a complex work system. This study aimed to apply both perspectives to the examination of violations in community pharmacies. Design Twenty-four participants (13 pharmacists and 11 pharmacy support staff) were purposively sampled to participate in semi-structured interviews using the critical incident technique. Participants described violations they made during the course of their work. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis. Setting Community pharmacies located in England and Wales. Results 31 procedural violations were described during the interviews revealing multiple reasons for violations in this setting. Our findings suggest that from a Safety-II perspective, staff violated to adapt to situations and to manage safety. However, participants also violated procedures in order to maintain productivity which was found to increase risk in some, but not all situations. Procedural violations often relied on the context in which staff were working, resulting in the violation being deemed rational to the individual making the violation, yet the behaviour may be difficult to justify from an outside perspective. Conclusions Combining Safety-I and Safety-II perspectives provided a detailed understanding of the underlying reasons for procedural violations. Our findings identify aspects of practice that could benefit from targeted interventions to help support staff in providing safe patient care.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:47","2019-02-27 20:57:47","","114 - 120","","","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; Patient safety; Pharmacy; Primary care; qualitative research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this article is to describe the methods and design of a qualitative urban health study. Methods The Heart Healthy Hoods (HHH) analyses cardiovascular health in an urban environment using mixed methods: electronic health records, quantitative individual questionnaires, physical examination, semi-structured Interviews (SSIs), focus groups (FGs) and participatory technics such as photovoice. This article focuses on the HHH qualitative methods and design. A case study was used to select three neighbourhoods in Madrid with different socioeconomic levels: low, medium, and high. The selection process for these three neighbourhoods was as follows: classification of all Madrid's neighbourhoods (128) according to their socioeconomic level; after ranking this classification, nine neighbourhoods, three by socioeconomic level, were short-listed; different urban sociology criteria and non-participant observation were used for the final selection of three neighbourhoods. After selecting the three neighbourhoods, thirty SSIs were held with residents and six SSIs were held with key informants. Finally, twenty-nine FGs will be conducted over the course of 8 months, between May and December of 2018. Conclusions Systematization in the selection of neighbourhoods and the use of adequate techniques are essential for the qualitative study of urban health inequalities.

El objetivo de este artículo es describir los métodos y el diseño de un estudio cualitativo sobre salud urbana. Método Heart Healthy Hoods (HHH) es un estudio que analiza la salud cardiovascular en un ámbito urbano, utilizando métodos mixtos: registros electrónicos de salud, cuestionarios individuales cuantitativos, exploraciones físicas, entrevistas semiestructuradas (ESE), grupos de discusión (GD) y técnicas participativas como el fotovoz. Este artículo se centra en los métodos y el diseño de la fase cualitativa del HHH. Se aplicó un estudio de caso, seleccionando tres barrios de Madrid con diferente nivel socioeconómico: bajo, medio y alto. El proceso de selección para estos tres barrios fue el siguiente: clasificación de todos los barrios de Madrid (128) según su nivel socioeconómico; tras graduar la clasificación se seleccionaron nueve barrios de Madrid, tres por nivel socioeconómico; se utilizaron diferentes criterios de sociología urbana y observación no participante para la selección final de tres barrios. Tras la elección de los tres barrios, se realizaron 30 ESE a vecinos y 6 ESE a informantes clave. Finalmente, se están organizando 29 GD con vecinos durante 8 meses, entre mayo y diciembre de 2018.

Research has shown that citizens have a limited understanding of the ocean and it is this lack of ocean literacy that needs to change. This study maps the European landscape of barriers to teaching 12–19 year olds about the ocean, through the application of Collective Intelligence, a facilitation and problem solving methodology. The paper presents a meta-analysis of the 657 barriers to teaching about the ocean, highlighting how these barriers are interconnected and influence one another in a European Influence Map. The influence map shows 8 themes: Awareness and Perceived knowledge; Policies and Strategies; Engagement, formal education sector; the Ocean itself; Collaboration; Connections between humans and the ocean and the Blue Economy, having the greatest influence and impact on marine education. “Awareness and Perceived knowledge” in Stage 1, exerts the highest level of overall influence in teaching 12–19 year olds about the ocean. This map and study serves as a roadmap for policy makers to implement mobilisation actions that could mitigate the barriers to teaching about the ocean. Examples of such actions include free marine education learning resources such as e-books, virtual laboratories or hands-on experiments. Thus, supporting educators in taking on the challenge of helping our youth realise that the ocean supports life on Earth is essential for education, the marine and human well-being.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:46","2019-02-27 20:57:46","","85 - 96","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This choice of methodology is driven by predominant theories that tie environmental attitudes to the multidimensional construct of environmental concern. This paper demonstrates that using a clustering method such as latent class analysis can be a valuable tool for studying environmental attitudes as they exist within a given population. In making the case for the value of latent class analysis in this context, we examine UK public concern for the environment and how this concern is associated with pro-environmental behaviours. To do this we use responses to DEFRA's 2009 Survey of Public Attitudes and Behaviours towards the Environment, which is still the most nationally representative survey of its type in the UK. Grouping respondents according to homogenous response patterns, we identify four classes of people, defined by their concern for the environment: Pro-environment, Neutral Majority, Disengaged and Paradoxical. To understand how these attitude classes are associated with behaviour and socio-economic status, class membership probability is regressed onto education, income and social grade, as well as 16 measures of environmental behaviour related to transport, food, recycling and home energy conservation. The results contradict most previous research with the environmental attitude classes by being highly predictive of environmental behaviour.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:57","2019-02-27 20:57:57","","210 - 222","","","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on the verification of the substitution or enhancement thesis: Do virtual activities substitute trips, do they enhance additional trips or are they just another type of activities without any influence on physical mobility? We use individual data on the ICT use and travel behavior of 14- to 24-year-olds collected in the project U.Move 2.0. The data allow detailed analyses of the connection between virtual and physical mobility on an individual level. Our analyses show a slightly stronger enhancement effect of the ICT use although the enhancement and substitution of trips are not exclusive but rather coexist even on an individual level. Furthermore, virtual mobility as well as physical mobility and their connection have to be seen in a wider context of sociodemographic factors and milieus. Basically, the virtual and physical mobility of young people who grew up with ICT as a matter of course in their everyday lives are two supplementary types of activities that are connected in a complex way.","2018","2019-02-27 20:57:04","2019-02-27 20:57:04","","11 - 17","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital natives; Enhancement; ICT; social media; Substitution; Travel behavior; Young people","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though to become a therapy dog, the dog must pass an evaluation, most evaluations do not take into account disposition. Thus, a dog could become certified as a therapy dog but still become uncomfortable in stressful situations. Therefore, it is important to understand the magnitude of stress therapy dogs may experience during visits and if the amount of visits per month affects the level of stress. In this 4 × 4 Latin square-designed pilot study, four therapy dog teams were randomly assigned to an outpatient nursing unit at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. The therapy dog teams were then randomly assigned to the order of the four treatments. The treatments include: treatment A, two visits a week over the course of four weeks; treatment B, one visit a week over the course of four weeks; treatment C, two visits over the course of four weeks; treatment D, one visit over the course of four weeks. Interestingly, this study noted a dog × time effect. Dog 3, the youngest in the study, had the highest postsalivary cortisol for treatment A, C, and D. When comparing pre and postsalivary cortisol concentrations, only treatment A was significantly different (P = 0.04). This novel study was the first to assess the frequency of therapy dog visits’ effect on therapy dog salivary cortisol. In comparing baseline to postvisit salivary cortisol concentration, treatment A had a significant reduction in cortisol postvisit. These data suggest that the more frequently, two visits a week, the therapy dog visits, the lower the cortisol concentrations will be. To further evaluate the welfare and potential state of stress in therapy dogs, researchers need to collect additional biological, objective parameters and have visits uniformed and recorded for behavioral analysis.","2019","2019-02-27 20:57:14","2019-02-27 20:57:14","","88 - 91","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","animal assisted therapy; cortisol; therapy dog; Welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
