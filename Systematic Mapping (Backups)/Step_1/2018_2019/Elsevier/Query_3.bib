abstract = "This survey paper is designed to present the state-of-the-art and comparative study of performance prediction in online discussion forum using data mining techniques and is dedicated to provide a guideline or roadmap as a prediction tool leading to effective interactions with full use of online discussion forum. There are different features, methods and techniques of data mining applying performance prediction in online discussion forum from 2011-2016 data. The inclination and the tip from the data help the researcher to analyze the potency of online discussion forum in predicting students’ performance. Hence, it becomes a benchmark to find new and meaningful innovations for research, not only in education but also in all aspects of the fields. This paper also provides recommendations for students and educators to give sufficient information to preserve and ameliorate learning process by monitoring the progress of students’ performance via prediction tools using data mining. Students’ performances are mainly observed to decide the level of students’ progress to determine if a student will remain involved or quit the study. Such critical issue is obviously faced by many educational institutions. Hence, performance prediction is obviously important to be applied, not only in educational field but also the others as it avoids the students’ reduction potential in educational institutions. In addition, it also improves the students’ standard and knack through active engagement. It also helps highly-risked students to recognize the weakness of the study program."

Background
Although childhood overweight and obesity prevalence has increased substantially worldwide in the past three decades, scarce evidence exists for effective preventive strategies. We aimed to establish whether a school-based intervention for children aged 9–10 years would prevent excessive weight gain after 24 months.
Methods
This pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of the Healthy Lifestyles Programme (HeLP), a school-based obesity prevention intervention, was done in 32 schools in southwest England. All state-run primary and junior schools in Devon and Plymouth (UK) with enough pupils for at least one year-5 class were eligible. Schools were assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated sequence to either intervention or control, stratified by the number of year-5 classes (one vs more than one) and the proportion of children eligible for free school meals (<19% [the national average] vs ≥19%). HeLP was delivered to year-5 children (ages 9–10 years) over 1 year, and included dynamic and interactive activities such as physical activity workshops, education sessions delivered by teachers with short homework tasks, drama sessions, and setting goals to modify behaviour (with parental support and one-to-one discussions with HeLP coordinators). The primary outcome was change in body-mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) between baseline and 24 months, analysed in children with BMI data available for both timepoints. This study is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial register, number ISRCTN15811706, and the trial status is complete.
Findings
Between March 21, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013, 32 eligible schools with 1324 children were recruited, of which 16 schools (676 children) were randomly assigned to the HeLP intervention and 16 schools (648 children) to control. All schools that began the trial completed the intervention, and 1244 children (628 in intervention group and 616 in control group) had BMI data at both baseline and 24 months for the primary outcome analysis. Mean BMI SDS was 0·32 (SD 1·16) at baseline and 0·35 (1·25) at 24 months in the intervention group, and 0·18 (1·14) at baseline and 0·22 (1·22) at 24 months in the control group. With adjustment for school-level clustering, baseline BMI scores, sex, cohort, and number of year-5 classes and socioeconomic status of each school, the mean difference in BMI SDS score (intervention–control) at 24 months was −0·02 (95% CI −0·09 to 0·05), p=0·57. One parent reported an adverse event related to their child's eating and activity behaviours, but agreed for the child to continue trial participation after discussion with the chief investigator.
Interpretation
Despite a theoretically informed and extensively piloted intervention that achieved high levels of engagement, follow-up, and fidelity of delivery, we found no effect of the intervention on preventing overweight or obesity. Although schools are an ideal setting in which to deliver population-based interventions, school-based interventions might not be sufficiently intense to affect both the school and the family environment, and hence the weight status of children. Future research should focus on more upstream determinants of obesity and use whole-systems approaches.

abstract = "In this study, we analyse the relationship between engagement in a virtual learning environment (VLE) and module grades at a ‘bricks-and-mortar’ university in the United Kingdom. We measure VLE activity for students enrolled in 38 different credit-bearing modules, each of which are compulsory components of six degree programmes. Overall we find that high VLE activity is associated with high grades, but low activity does not necessarily imply low grades. Analysis of individual modules shows a wide range of relationships between the two quantities. Grouping module-level relationships by programme suggests that science-based subjects have a higher dependency on VLE activity. Considering learning design (LD), we find that VLE usage is more important in modules that adopt an instruction-based learning style. We also test the predictive power of VLE usage in determining grades, again finding variation between degree programmes and potential for predicting a student's final grade weeks in advance of assessment. Our findings suggest that student engagement with learning at a bricks-and-mortar university is in general hard to determine by VLE usage alone, due to the predominance of other “offline” learning activities, but that VLE usage can nonetheless help to predict performance for some disciplines."
