abstract = "This survey paper is designed to present the state-of-the-art and comparative study of performance prediction in online discussion forum using data mining techniques and is dedicated to provide a guideline or roadmap as a prediction tool leading to effective interactions with full use of online discussion forum. There are different features, methods and techniques of data mining applying performance prediction in online discussion forum from 2011-2016 data. The inclination and the tip from the data help the researcher to analyze the potency of online discussion forum in predicting students’ performance. Hence, it becomes a benchmark to find new and meaningful innovations for research, not only in education but also in all aspects of the fields. This paper also provides recommendations for students and educators to give sufficient information to preserve and ameliorate learning process by monitoring the progress of students’ performance via prediction tools using data mining. Students’ performances are mainly observed to decide the level of students’ progress to determine if a student will remain involved or quit the study. Such critical issue is obviously faced by many educational institutions. Hence, performance prediction is obviously important to be applied, not only in educational field but also the others as it avoids the students’ reduction potential in educational institutions. In addition, it also improves the students’ standard and knack through active engagement. It also helps highly-risked students to recognize the weakness of the study program."
