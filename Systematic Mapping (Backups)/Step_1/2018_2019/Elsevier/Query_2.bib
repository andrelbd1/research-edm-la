abstract = "Gamification nowadays is being one of techniques that can increase motivation and encourage the involvement of users, particularly in education domain that requires teaching and learning activities to be more fun and interesting. This paper surveys some analysis of gamification models. MDA framework is used to identify surveyed papers by breaking them down into three categories: mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Findings from the survey show there are many gamification models in education domain. However, there are some very representative gamification models could be used as a method to increase motivation, achievement and engagement in learning activities. By knowing the latest gamification models in education domain stated in this paper, it could help gamification practitioners to make new strategies in learning activities to increase students’ motivation, achievement and involvement. We also suggest some gamification strategies, which combine several mechanics in such a way to create dynamics that results in all types of aesthetics outputs."

abstract = "In this study, we analyse the relationship between engagement in a virtual learning environment (VLE) and module grades at a ‘bricks-and-mortar’ university in the United Kingdom. We measure VLE activity for students enrolled in 38 different credit-bearing modules, each of which are compulsory components of six degree programmes. Overall we find that high VLE activity is associated with high grades, but low activity does not necessarily imply low grades. Analysis of individual modules shows a wide range of relationships between the two quantities. Grouping module-level relationships by programme suggests that science-based subjects have a higher dependency on VLE activity. Considering learning design (LD), we find that VLE usage is more important in modules that adopt an instruction-based learning style. We also test the predictive power of VLE usage in determining grades, again finding variation between degree programmes and potential for predicting a student's final grade weeks in advance of assessment. Our findings suggest that student engagement with learning at a bricks-and-mortar university is in general hard to determine by VLE usage alone, due to the predominance of other “offline” learning activities, but that VLE usage can nonetheless help to predict performance for some disciplines."
