abstract = {This paper introduces a hybridization approach of {\{}AI{\}} techniques and statistical tools to evaluate and adapt the e-learning systems including e-learners. Learner's profile plays a crucial role in the evaluation process and the recommendations to improve the e-learning process. This work classifies the learners into specific categories based on the learner's profiles; the learners' classes named as regular, workers, casual, bad, and absent. The work extracted the statistical usage patterns that give a clear map describing the data and helping in constructing the e-learning system. The work tries to find the answers of the question how to return the bad students who are away back to be regular ones and find a method to evaluate the e-learners as well as to adapt the content and structure of the e-learning system. The work introduces the application of different fuzzy clustering techniques (FCM and KFCM) to find the learners profiles. Different phases of the work are presented. Analysis of the results and comparison: There is a match with a 78{\%} with the real world behavior and the fuzzy clustering reflects the learners' behavior perfectly. Comparison between {\{}FCM{\}} and {\{}KFCM{\}} proved that the {\{}KFCM{\}} is much better than FCM.},

abstract = {The role of discussion forums is an essential part of online courses in tertiary education. Activities in discussion forums help learners to share and gain knowledge from each other.. In fully online courses, discussion forums are often the only medium of interaction. However, merely setting up discussion forums does not ensure that learners interact with each other actively and investigation into the type of participation is required to ensure quality participation. This paper provides a general overview of how fully online students participate in discussion forums and the correlation between their activity online and achievement in terms of grades. The main benefit of this research is that it provides a benchmark for the trend of participation expected of the fully online introductory information technology and programming students. Investigating the participation and the factors behind online behaviour can provide guidelines for continual development of online learning systems. . The results of the data analysis reveal that a high number of students are not accessing or posting in the discussion board. Results also show that there is a correlation between activity of students' in online forums and the grades they achieve. Discussion about the findings of data analysis and the lessons learned from this research are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Recent studies come to the conclusion that Learning Management System (LMS) usage variables explain a higher variation in students' final grades than traditional student characteristics. Referring to such findings from literature our research aims at exploring dependencies between e-learning usage patterns and achieved learning results on the basis of LMS log-files from courses in different knowledge domains, and by analyzing courses not in isolation but by taking potential dependencies with students' activities in other courses into account. We examine correlations between usage variables and the students' performance in three blended learning courses with different topics based on large cohorts of students (n=883, n=389, n=578). In this context, an extended set of variables, including LMS usage beyond the three courses and usage patterns of students, are examined for interdependencies. Our results indicate that specific indicators, such as the number of active learning days and topic views, have a positive influence on learning results. In general, they show that at-risk students can be differentiated from well-performing students by their usage behavior. Moreover, we try to identify some significant patterns of LMS usage amongst the students. The paper shows how these patterns differ in our observations depending on the course domains.},

We apply data mining and text mining techniques to analyze two different datasets and then conducted an in-depth correlation analysis for two educational courses with the most online questions and chat messages respectively. The study found the discrepancies as well as similarities in the students' patterns and themes of participation between online questions (student–instructor interaction) and online chat messages (student–students interaction or peer interaction). The results also identify disciplinary differences in students' online participation. A correlation is found between the number of online questions students asked and students' final grades. The data suggests that a combination of using data mining and text mining techniques for a large amount of online learning data can yield considerable insights and reveal valuable patterns in students' learning behaviors. Limitations with data and text mining were also revealed and discussed in the paper.},

In previous research by the present author, digital immigrants from a baby-boomer cohort fare better than digital natives due to social reliance and meaningful posts. Meaningful posts include discussion comments that reflect meaning-based engagement with the course material. Students with optimal patterns and types of discussion participation do better than those students who just follow a point system of quantity-based engagement. Students were given three behavioral assessments and then monitored for meaningful posts and successful online behavior using the tracking features within Blackboard. Results were analyzed using a multiple regression and showed that a significant percentage of online learning is predicted by meaningful posts and homework performance while total online activity does not uniquely predict learning outcomes. Students with more meaningful posts show more engagement with the online materials and better learning than those with less meaningful posts.},

abstract = {Abstract The constant development of new Internet platforms is shifting the users' role of such platforms, from viewers to main actors. In the field of education, faculty can take advantage of these new technologies for the design of pedagogical contents. The face-to-face observation of behavioral patterns allows faculty to detect and track new problems, and to apply possible corrections which would improve the learning/teaching process. However, with a distance methodology, these observations are not possible. When forums are created they are intended to discuss particular topics. It is relevant to monitor that the topics discussed are the intended ones in order to achieve course objectives. To tackle this shortcoming, our work studies the dynamics of relevant topics in on-line asynchronous discussion forums, and this is done by analyzing the large amount of students' interactions generated in the forums of our Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we analyze the students' behavior patterns in the forums of a distance subject, and characterize the relevant topics and subtopics from the forums' messages belonging to two academic years. From the statistical and graphical results obtained, a set of valuable recommendations are also given.},

abstract = {The current generation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a diverse student audience from all age groups and over 196 countries around the world. Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content. This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140, 546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22{\%} of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course. From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade. Finally, to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our findings, we have made our data set and analysis scripts publicly available.},

Previous studies generally focus on the construction of predictors for learner performance evaluation after a course has ended, and neglect the practical value of an “early warning” system to predict at-risk students while a course is in progress. We collected the complete learning activities of an online undergraduate course and applied data-mining techniques to develop an early warning system. Our results showed that, time-dependent variables extracted from {\{}LMS{\}} are critical factors for online learning. After students have used an {\{}LMS{\}} for a period of time, our early warning system effectively characterizes their current learning performance. Data-mining techniques are useful in the construction of early warning systems; based on our experimental results, classification and regression tree (CART), supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifier for the evaluation of learning performance investigated by this study.},

abstract = {The Web has enabled one of the most visible recent developments in education---the deployment of massive open online courses. With their global reach and often staggering enrollments, MOOCs have the potential to become a major new mechanism for learning. Despite this early promise, however, MOOCs are still relatively unexplored and poorly understood. In a MOOC, each student's complete interaction with the course materials takes place on the Web, thus providing a record of learner activity of unprecedented scale and resolution. In this work, we use such trace data to develop a conceptual framework for understanding how users currently engage with MOOCs. We develop a taxonomy of individual behavior, examine the different behavioral patterns of high- and low-achieving students, and investigate how forum participation relates to other parts of the course. We also report on a large-scale deployment of badges as incentives for engagement in a MOOC, including randomized experiments in which the presentation of badges was varied across sub-populations. We find that making badges more salient produced increases in forum engagement.},

abstract = {With thousands of learners watching the same online lecture videos, analyzing video watching patterns provides a unique opportunity to understand how students learn with videos. This paper reports a large-scale analysis of in-video dropout and peaks in viewership and student activity, using second-by-second user interaction data from 862 videos in four Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on edX. We find higher dropout rates in longer videos, re-watching sessions (vs first-time), and tutorials (vs lectures). Peaks in re-watching sessions and play events indicate points of interest and confusion. Results show that tutorials (vs lectures) and re-watching sessions (vs first-time) lead to more frequent and sharper peaks. In attempting to reason why peaks occur by sampling 80 videos, we observe that 61{\%} of the peaks accompany visual transitions in the video, e.g., a slide view to a classroom view. Based on this observation, we identify five student activity patterns that can explain peaks: starting from the beginning of a new material, returning to missed content, following a tutorial step, replaying a brief segment, and repeating a non-visual explanation. Our analysis has design implications for video authoring, editing, and interface design, providing a richer understanding of video learning on MOOCs.},
address = {New York, New York, USA},
annote = {This paper presents an empirical study of students' engagement with MOOC videos, as mea-sured by how long students are watching each video, and whether they attempt to answer post-video assessment problems.

The main question is: "Which kinds of videos lead to the best stu- dent learning outcomes in a MOOC?"

Result: Video production affects user engagement to some extent, since user interacting experience with video depends on the style of video production.

Due to the dataset is so poor, fidings become not reliable. In addition, the authors do not take in account important features as for example: teaching practice. 

The dataset could be better if this paper had used a dataset with the same teachers performing all the explored features.

To improve external validity, these analyses should be replicated on additional, more diverse courses.

The main limitation of some analysis is that they had only one pair of courses to compare, and they differed in instructors and subject matter.},

This study examines the relation between {\{}SNA{\}} parameters and student outcomes, between network parameters and global course performance, and it shows how visualizations of social learning analytics can help observing the visible and invisible interactions occurring in online distance education. The findings from our empirical study show that future research should further investigate whether there are conditions under which social network parameters are reliable predictors of academic performance, but also advises against relying exclusively in social network parameters for predictive purposes. The findings also show that data visualization is a useful tool for social learning analytics, and how it may provide additional information about actors and their behaviors for decision making in online distance learning.},

This data exploration is intended not to validate pre-defined questions or specific goals (for example, a comparison between engagement and academic scores) but to discover usage trends and obtain insights about users' usage of the system and their knowledge of and proficiency with the available resources and features. The engagement indicators and knowledge obtained from the analysis of these indicators regarding the users of the system, their desires, and their competencies with virtual resources will facilitate decision-making and planning by managers of the Virtual World to improve system adoption and learning effectiveness, correct usage mistakes, perform actions to enhance user exploitation of available features, and provide information to users on system usage. This knowledge and the actions based on it are capital in an eLearning ecosystem such as an Educational Virtual World, where students are able to perform tasks in 3D at any time or location without supervision.},

abstract = {Abstract Automatic identification of learners attributes is the main trend in development of e-learning environments and providing personalized learning path. Many learners' characteristics may be considered to provide personalized learning that fit into individual's needs. Understanding individual differences in learning is an important issue in educational psychology. Many studies attest that learning process can be more effective by considering personality traits. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy inference system, ALPIS, to identify the Big-Five Personality from learner's network behaviors. The proposed system had been implemented through {\{}MATLAB{\}} fuzzy tools. We conducted an experimental study in real e-learning environment with 53 students (29 male and 24 female) to evaluate the {\{}ALPIS{\}} performance. Comparing to the conventional inventory-based psychological analysis (NEO-FFI) we demonstrate that learners' personality can be predicted with reasonable precision based on their online behaviors. Experiments have shown that {\{}ALPIS{\}} is able to automatically detect learners' personality with accuracy at least 78{\%} on medium Agreeableness category and 97{\%} on low extroversion category. Because of using learners' behaviors {\{}ALPIS{\}} provides a reasonable precision in personality detection.},

abstract = {Abstract Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of {\{}LMS{\}} users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way {\{}LMS{\}} users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the {\{}LMS{\}} use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle {\{}LMS{\}} users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the {\{}LMS{\}} use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of {\{}HEIs{\}} could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess {\{}OLEs{\}} stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices.},

abstract = {Abstract Summer bridge programs are designed to improve retention and academic success among at-risk populations in postsecondary education by focusing on successful skills, behaviors, and high impact practices that promote academic performance. Recent research on these programs has focused primarily on how students' incoming demographics and prior academic performance predict academic performance at the university level. This study investigated changes in students' academic motivation orientations over the course of one bridge program, and how a learning analytics-based intervention was employed by academic advisors to inform their face-to-face meetings with students. The results of our study show that students' mastery orientation decreased over the course of the bridge program, and indicate that students' exposure to displays of their academic performance negatively predicts this change. The findings suggest that student perceptions of their goals and formative performance need to be carefully considered in the design of learning analytics interventions since the resulting tools can affect students' interpretations of their own data as well as their subsequent academic success.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of electronic media in education has a strong impact of on student performance. Prior research has investigated the impact of forum reading and posting, as well as access to reading resources, on academic performance. However, little is known about the relationship between the temporal frequency of these activities and individual student's performance. In addition, some studies have proposed different categorizations of student activities, and proved the usefulness of these characterizations for predictive purposes and better understanding of the learning process. One of the biggest concerns when teaching courses in a virtual learning environment is to create and develop instruction in a way that it improves the overall learning experience and results. The present study addresses this concern by drawing upon factors influencing academic performance; more specifically, the study focuses on objective factors related to the interaction between the student and the system (number of resources visited in the learning platform, and number of forum posts and views). On top of that, a visualization tool was designed and implemented to allow for further investigation of the relevance of the study variables. The results from the study show that there is a recurrent pattern in the frequency of behaviors and performance across different courses.},

This paper presents an analysis framework that can be used to identify crucial aspects of the collaborative problem solving process in practice-based learning activities. We deployed a mixed-methods approach that allowed us to generate an analysis framework that is theoretically robust, and generalizable. Additionally, the framework is grounded in data and hence applicable to real-life learning contexts. This paper presents how our framework was developed and how it can be used to analyse data. We argue for the value of effective analysis frameworks in the generation and presentation of learning analytics for practice-based learning activities.},

abstract = {Differences in learners' behavior have a deep impact on their educational performance. Consequently, there is a need to detect and identify these differences and build suitable learner models accordingly. In this paper, we report on the results from an alternative approach for dynamic student behavioral modeling based on the analysis of time-based student-generated trace data. The goal was to unobtrusively classify students according to their time-spent behavior. We applied 5 different supervised learning classification algorithms on these data, using as target values (class labels) the students' performance score classes during a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) process, and compared the obtained results. The proposed approach has been explored in a study with 259 undergraduate university participant students. The analysis of the findings revealed that a) the low misclassification rates are indicative of the accuracy of the applied method and b) the ensemble learning (treeBagger) method provides better classification results compared to the others. These preliminary results are encouraging, indicating that a time-spent driven description of the students' behavior could have an added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models.},

abstract = {The pervasive collection of data has opened the possibility for educational institutions to use analytics methods to improve the quality of the student experience. However, the adoption of these methods faces multiple challenges particularly at the course level where instructors and students would derive the most benefit from the use of analytics and predictive models. The challenge lies in the knowledge gap between how the data is captured, processed and used to derive models of student behavior, and the subsequent interpretation and the decision to deploy pedagogical actions and interventions by instructors. Simply put, the provision of learning analytics alone has not necessarily led to changing teaching practices. In order to support pedagogical change and aid interpretation, this paper proposes a model that can enable instructors to readily identify subpopulations of students to provide specific support actions. The approach was applied to a first year course with a large number of students. The resulting model classifies students according to their predicted exam scores, based on indicators directly derived from the learning design.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which collect complete records of all student interactions in an online learning environment, offer us an unprecedented opportunity to analyze students' learning behavior at a very fine granularity than ever before. Using dataset from xuetangX, one of the largest MOOCs from China, we analyze key factors that influence students' engagement in MOOCs and study to what extent we could infer a student's learning effectiveness. We observe significant behavioral heterogeneity in students' course selection as well as their learning patterns. For example, students who exert higher effort and ask more questions are not necessarily more likely to get certificates. Additionally, the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically (3 x higher) when she has one or more "certificate friends". Moreover, we develop a unified model to predict students' learning effectiveness, by incorporating user demographics, forum activities, and learning behavior. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+2.03-9.03{\%} by F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting students' performance on assignments and course certificates. The model is flexible and can be applied to various settings. For example, we are deploying a new feature into xuetangX to help teachers dynamically optimize the teaching process.},

abstract = {Abstract The behavior of users over the web is one of the most relevant and research topic nowadays. Not only mining the user׳s behavior in order to provide better content is popular, but the prediction of the user׳s behavior is interesting and can increase user experience. Moreover, the business clearly desires such information to improve their services. In this paper we focus to the education domain as it belongs to the most dynamically transforming areas. Web based e-learning systems are nowadays reaching still greater popularity, because of possibilities they offer to students. We analyze various sources of “e-students” feedback and discuss today׳s challenges from the logging and feedback collecting point of view. Next, we focus on the prediction of student׳s next action within an e-learning application (in the mean of “stay or leave?” question). Such information can improve students׳ attrition rate by introducing various personalized approaches. We proposed the classifier based on polynomial regression and stochastic gradient descent to learn the attributes importance. In this way we are able to process a stream of data in one single iteration and thus we are able to reflect dynamic users׳ behavior changes. Our experiments are based on the log data collected from our web-based education system {\{}ALEF{\}} during three-year period. We found that there is an extensive heterogeneity in the users׳ (student) behavior which we were able to handle by using individual weights calculated for every user.},

abstract = {Abstract Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently taken center stage in discussions surrounding online education, both in terms of their potential as well as their high dropout rates. The high attrition rates associated with {\{}MOOCs{\}} have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with {\{}MOOCs{\}} and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.},

We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics.},

In prior research, we explored the relationship between (a) students' programming behaviors and course outcomes, and (b) students' participation within an online social learning environment and course outcomes. In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students' course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide significantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success.},

abstract = {Modeling a student's knowledge state while she is solving exercises is a crucial stepping stone towards providing bet-ter personalized learning experiences at scale. This task, also referred to as " knowledge tracing " , has been explored extensively on exercises where student submissions fall into a finite discrete solution space, e.g. a multiple-choice answer. However, we believe that rich information about a student's learning is captured within their responses to open-ended problems with unbounded solution spaces, such as programming exercises. In addition, sequential snapshots of a student's progress while she is solving a single exercise can provide valuable insights into her learning behavior. In this setting, creating representa-tions for a student's knowledge state is a challenging task, but with recent advances in machine learning, there are more promising techniques to learn representations for complex entities. In our work, we feed the embedded program submissions into a recurrent neural network and train it on the task of predicting the student's success on the subsequent programming exercise. By training on this task, the model learns nuanced representations of a student's knowledge, and reliably predicts future student performance.},

abstract = {Abstract The increase of student's disengagement is a problem in many developed countries' educational systems. This paper presents our approach on how the usage of {\{}VLEs{\}} (Virtual Learning Environments) can be traced and used to enhance the teaching quality so as to improve engagement. We focus our work on secondary education. The question is not to predict the performance of students, from the collected data, which is always controversial; or just define a set of pre-established metrics, obtained from the digital data contained into the VLE, and monitor them, indirectly inducing an assessment regime. The aim is to look beyond the traces left by students and to measure the motivation of a student in a particular task, of a given subject, and in a specific day. For this purpose, we rely on the psychometric theory of measurement to build a composite index of motivation and we embed it into a Learning Analytics system. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide teachers and stakeholders with objective and accurate (quasi) real time information about students' motivation for learning, and hence adequately adapt and personalize the teaching methodologies and strategies in classrooms. The approach is general and can also be used in tertiary education for training students and researchers in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing.},

This is in part due tothe lack of sophisticated tools to provide interpretable and actionable summaries of huge amounts ofMOOC activity present in log data. To address this problem, we propose a student behavior representationmethod alongside a method for automatically discovering those student behavior patterns by leveragingthe click log data that can be obtained from the MOOC platform itself. Specifically, we propose the use ofa two-layer hidden Markov model (2L-HMM) to extract our desired behavior representation, and showthat patterns extracted by such a 2L-HMM are interpretable and meaningful. We demonstrate that theproposed 2L-HMM can also be used to extract latent features from student behavioral data that correlatewith educational outcomes.},

Yet most prior research on MOOC dropout prediction has measured test accuracy on the same course used for training, which can lead to overly optimistic accuracy estimates. In order to understand better how accuracy is affected by the training+testing regime, we compared the accuracy of a standard dropout prediction architecture (clickstream features + logistic regression) across 4 different training paradigms. Re-sults suggest that (1) training and testing on the same course (" post-hoc ") can significantly overestimate accu-racy. Moreover, (2) training dropout classifiers using proxy labels based on students' persistence – which are available before a MOOC finishes – is surprisingly com-petitive with post-hoc training (87.33{\%} v. 90.20{\%} AUC averaged over 8 weeks of 40 HarvardX MOOCs) and can support real-time MOOC interventions.},

Until now, there are more than twenty MOOC platforms online. Some studies pointed out that students, however, can hardly follow a course till the end on MOOCs. For most courses, less than 13{\%} of students could follow. Such a high dropout rate will restrict development of MOOCs in the future. This paper shows an observation of MOOC data. A statistic analysis is applied to students' behavioral data. The result is discussed in the perspective of course design on MOOC platform. A general system for predicting students' dropout is developed. With unsupervised learning, the system can fit on different ongoing courses. A discussion of this system with Data Structures and Algorithms course is conducted. We also apply the system to Introduction to Computing course to test scalability.

This intention-action gap is found in many domains of human experience, and research in similar goal pursuit domains suggests that plan-making is a cheap and effective nudge to encourage follow-through. In a natural field experiment in three HarvardX courses, some students received open-ended planning prompts at the beginning of a course. These prompts increased course completion by 29{\%}, and payment for certificates by 40{\%}. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed -in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course. Our results suggest that planning prompts can help learners adopted productive frames of mind at the outset of a learning goal that encourage and forecast student success.},

abstract = {With the emergence of online learning, many similar courses are offered on the Internet. The Internet is an essential tool for improving learning efficiency by analyzing how learners select courses; it is also a convenient channel to extract learner preferences. We adopt dynamic learning data from a popular Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) website in China, imooc.com, to detect the online learning behavior pattern of Chinese online learners and estimate herding behavior. Considering the large number of similar online courses, this study determines how a suitable course can be selected. We first evince the existence of herding in online learning and then divide herding behavior into different groups: some learners passively mimic their peers (irrational herding), whereas some learners engage in active observational learning according to their needs (rational herding). The results reveal that rational herding dominates online learning. Subsequently, some variables amplify the herding effect, such as the difficulty level of the course and the experience of the learners. We conclude that the higher the difficulty level of a course, the more the rational herding of the learners and that the more experienced the learners, the higher the rational herding. This study provides implications for the way in course selection in MOOC, specifically in the learning analytics of the online learners.},

In literature, we can find many references to weaker students, fast learners, struggling students, etc. Given the lack of detailed data about students, these or other kinds of stereotypes could be potentially used for user modeling and personalization in the educational context. Recent research in MOOC context demonstrated that data-driven learner stereotypes could work well for detecting and preventing student dropouts. In this paper, we are exploring the application of stereotype-based modeling to a more challenging task - predicting student problemsolving and learning in two programming courses and two MOOCs. We explore traditional stereotypes based on readily available factors like gender or education level as well as some advanced data-driven approaches to group students based on their problem-solving behavior. Each of the approaches to form student stereotype cohorts is validated by comparing models of student learning: do students in different groups learn differently? In the search for the stereotypes that could be used for adaptation, the paper examines ten approaches. We compare the performance of these approaches and draw conclusions for future research.},

abstract = {In online learning environments, learners are ooen required to be more autonomous in their approach to learning. In scaled on-line learning environments, like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), there are diierences in the ability of learners to access teachers and peers to get help with their study than in more tradi-tional educational environments. exploratory study examines the help-seeking behaviour of learners across several MOOCs with diierent audiences and designs. Learning analytics techniques (e.g., dimension reduction with t-sne and clustering with aanity propa-gation) were applied to identify clusters and determine prooles of learners on the basis of their help-seeking behaviours. Five help-seeking learner prooles were identiied which provide an insight into how learners' help-seeking behaviour relates to performance. development of a more in-depth understanding of how learners seek help in large online learning environments is important to inform the way support for learners can be incorporated into the design and facilitation of online courses delivered at scale.},

abstract = {Educators continue to face significant challenges in providing high quality, post-secondary instruction in large classes including: motivating and engaging diverse populations (e.g., academic ability and backgrounds, generational expectations); and providing helpful feedback and guidance. Researchers investigate solutions to these kinds of challenges from alternative perspectives, including learning analytics (LA). Here, LA techniques are applied to explore the data collected for a large, flipped introductory programming class to (1) identify groups of students with similar patterns of performance and engagement; and (2) provide them with more meaningful appraisals that are tailored to help them effectively master the learning objectives. Two studies are reported, which apply clustering to analyze the class population, followed by an analysis of a subpopulation with extreme behaviours.},

abstract = {Abstract The aim of this paper is to explore students' behavior and interaction patterns in different types of online quiz-based activities within learning management systems (LMS). Analyzing students' behavior in online learning activities and detecting specific patterns of interaction in {\{}LMS{\}} is a topic of great interest for the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) research communities. Previous studies have focused primarily on frequency analysis without addressing the temporal aspects of students' learning behavior. Therefore, we apply a process-oriented approach, investigating perspectives on using process mining methods in the context of online learning and assessment. To explore a broad range of possible student behavior patterns, we analyze students' interactions in several online quizzes from different courses and with different settings. Using process mining methods, we identify specific types of interaction sequences that shed new light on students' quiz-taking strategies in LMS. We believe that these findings bring important implications for researchers studying student behavior in online environments as well as practitioners using online quizzes for learning and assessment.},

abstract = {The collaborative learning processes of students in online learning environments can be supported by providing learn-ing analytics-based visualisations that foster awareness and reflection about an individual's as well as the team's be-haviour and their learning and collaboration processes. For this empirical study we implemented an activity widget into the online learning environment of a live five-months Master course and investigated the predictive power of the widget indicators towards the students' grades and compared the re-sults to those from an exploratory study with data collected in previous runs of the same course where the widget had not been in use. Together with information gathered from a quantitative as well as a qualitative evaluation of the ac-tivity widget during the course, the findings of this current study show that there are indeed predictive relations be-tween the widget indicators and the grades, especially those regarding responsiveness, and indicate that some of the ob-served differences in the last run could be attributed to the implemented activity widget.},

@article{maldonado-mahauad_mining_2018,
abstract = {Abstract Big data in education offers unprecedented opportunities to support learners and advance research in the learning sciences. Analysis of observed behaviour using computational methods can uncover patterns that reflect theoretically established processes, such as those involved in self-regulated learning (SRL). This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from fine-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identified six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based {\{}SRL{\}} strategies and identified three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with specific course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners. Challenges that arise in the process of extracting theory-based patterns from observed behaviour are discussed, including analytic issues and limitations of available trace data from learning platforms.},
